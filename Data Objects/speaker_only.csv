 well the only problem I got is learning difficulties speech language and all that sometimes I get very erm emotional because erm my problems  and then and as I said I've got learning difficulties erm er I have learning difficulties so like sometimes I get panicky 
 you know and er it e effects my my feelings y I mean and my feelings what I'm feeling inside you know and like s an the erm feelings that I got is erm maybe   I get upset sometimes over nothing y I mean where I think of something you know erm I get upset over nothing so that's af affecting me in my own way my illness y I mean erm but   er an the thing is with with my problem is that   that's the reason  why we need reduction in my medication  maybe it will help 
 er I don't wanna have a relapse as the doctor says y I mean erm you know I know I have got problems y I mean I have a lot of problems you know I'm the thing is that I can't get on with my life and  without me not thinking  you know I mean I mean  if I could think for my own problems  then I'm sure things could work out for me you know to work to study my life an to study what's really going on the reality of my life y I mean people be saying to me I really I have a problem I have a problem big time you know mate as I said it may look good on the outside but on the inside it's telling a different story you know and people said to me what I go through basically is what I go through is my problem people say it's my own fault but I don't think it's my own fault  I don't think from the day one I was born  I didn't realise what was going on as a a young as a a young child like every young child erm is like every other child y no I mean you weren't brought up to hate people you what I mean 
 and like erm when you get older like my age and then you know the differences between people the way people feel you understand the way people you view people feeling gross do y I mean so it's a gross feeling you like you like you know of envy and jealousy people are jealous of seeing each other and like  had me going through this years  like I is when I went to school I thought I was like any other teenager you know yeah as an eighteen nineteen year old I wanted to study I wanted to do things that were right you know I wanted to get on with my life you know I know I I'm going on a bit 
  but problem is  is like people say to me I'm a fifty-five y know what they say I should write a book of what I'm going through y I mean and I'm talking about spiritually y I mean you know spiritually erm spiritually someone as I said when I said to you just a min ago it's it's they say people say it's my fault y I mean erm yeah it could be my fault but I don't think it is my fau I think I'm not responsible for what I'm going through y I mean 
 alright yeah exactly thank you I'm not responsible for wh I what I'm going through believe me people know people know y I mean they know body language y I mean they know an I have problems y I mean I do have problems and like basically I got to try and pick up the problem mm y know I've got to try and think or find a way of thinking to get myself out of these problems y I mean and this is why I get panicky you know you know I you know I I do have problems y I mean but I can't think to sort them out and every time you know when people say you need to solve your problems you have to think to solve your problems y I mean you know 
 it's hard the feeling is hard I have no feelings know I mean I have no feelings I have no feelings I feel numb and  that's what make life difficult for me  I have no feelings yeah but that's why I'm saying some people take advantage of my weakness you see because I've got no feelings they take advantage of my weakness y mm 
 wha 
 well they sa they they see something that's good inside me that's when you say like erm they don't like to see nothing they they've seen something that is something good inside me there's something good y I mean 
 and they don't like it y I mean I mean we all breathe we all breathe the same air y I mean but we have different thinking y I mean different thinking you know y and erm w erm 
 yeah 
 because they see something good but they don't like it it it upsets them like they have a problem with me listening y I mean if I was a lis er f if I'm a very good listener y I mean I I I listen in reality I listen crystal clear it's mm I may not think the other way the way other people think but I think the way I think 
 y I mean I think for me I got my as I said that's why I say I got my own problems  I have to think for my problems  y I mean and like when they know that you think you know when you breathe the fresh air then they they ha they have a problem with me listening right I breathe the air they get upset why they get upset I don't know y know they look me in my face dunno cos they know something that I don't know y I mean I'm telling you it took it may be a pat a part of my mm mental illness but I'm not stupid cos I know what I'm talking about y I mean 
 y know and they look in my face and I think to myself wh why are they looking in my face what y I mean 
 and like and when when I have to do li a bit of shopping Iâ€™m I'm not paranoid Iâ€™m I'm not paranoid I tell the truth when I do a bit of shopping they're focusing on on what's going in my bag not focus not they're not focusing on  their self  but they're focusing on what's going on in my bag y I mean now I'm a clever clever man a very clever clever man an like I don't really take crap from nobody y I mean 
 I'm a very very clever man and like if I could think for myself I could have nothing to do with the people who are very envious and they're jealous of what you've got y I mean because how can you be jealous of a person that you don't know how can you be jealous of a guy of something that he's got y I mean 
 do do you understand where I'm coming from mm I'm sure you must understand where I'm coming from 
 yeah y right so that's the reason why I'm saying I didn't think if if I did think I would not have been a mentally ill person believe me because I thought that I could handle the situation as a youngster I'm upset I'm a very angry man I'm angry and as I said I'm not responsible for my anger y I mean   I mean 
 I'm hurt I'm hurt y I mean and I got these people playing with my feelings all the time and I have to consid I have to say continuously I have to say you have to listen y I mean 
 you have to listen you must listen to people take advice from people and then if you listen you know where you stand with people there's a difference between two y I mean you know where you stand 
 you can't take advantage of your weakness y I mean 
   and that's what I mean you have to listen you know what you listen you know where you stand people can't take the mick they can't take the mick out of you I won't say the p-word y I mean y I mean 
 then they're saying wha when you think you're a dangerous man y I mean then they think well look this guy's not as stupid as he looks I was y I mean 
 yeah 
 people don't s er it's not about about listening people don't care people got their own problems y I mean people got people think for themselves life goes on y I mean life goes on that's the reason why I want to get on with my life y I mean I ain't got a life to live I got no time for er playing mind games 
 I got no time for it y I mean because mind games right is a dangerous thing very very dangerous you know right 
 believe me I won't keep you long 
 well er that's cool I'll talk but mind games right  is the book er are all the questions finished  or whatever 
 like I'm having a chat with you now yeah 
 OK sir mind games right is a thing that is dangerous right and if you don't know what you're doing people will play mind games with you y I mean they would they would that's why if you listen right to yourself and you listen to other people  maybe take a little bit advice  then you know they have different er thoughts about you y I mean they would leave you alone 
 and that's the problem the reason why I was in in this predicament I did not listen and I thought that I could handle the situation myself but I wasn't thinking and I wasn't listening and I'm still going through the same shit this has been I been going through this shit since the eight nineteen eighties having problems domestic problems y I mean you know 
 arguments with family  feel  problems and I don't know what's going on I mean they say to me oh   when are you getting married and then you think to yourself well what are they talking about when I'm getting married I don't know nothing about no marriage y I mean 
 and I think to myself well there's something that they know that I don't know 
 I tell you what yeah I'll tell you what I may be stupid but I'm not that stupid y I mean 
 I've said I've said some things that are very wrong but they were true very very wrong to the people in authority people are corrupt they are corrupt people are corrupt and that's why you got to think before you speak y I mean 
 y I mean you have to think before you speak y I mean and when you think before you think you got to a  ans  listen and  ansk  the right questions with people know what I mean 
 I'm not a happy man I may it might I might sound like I'm happy but I'm not happy and all I want to do is use my common sense to be happy for myself because I got my own problems and I'm still going through the same shit from my my this has been going on well I said those they said  I said to the top str er top secur erm top security er doctor doctor  what's the word doctor   from   hospital right all because when I was in prison think someone tried to to take advantage of me I wouldn't have it that's why people take advantage of your weakness right 
 and they said to me because I'd done that they thought that I was I had a problem with mm someone y I mean when in prison sometimes they try and take advantage and when I spoke to the doctor right I said the wrong things that were true to him he thought well this guy's  suffering from a paranoid schizophrenia illness  y  I mean now situation basically where they say  that I'm about to get married now for this marriage to work right plan is now is that Mr   right has to pick up a case in a public toilet and everything's gonna be alright problems will be solved I've got to run off with this girl and get married and the same girl that is making me suffer now and as I said to you I have no feelings I feel numb inside and it upsets me  that's why I'm a angry man  for what I'm going through and I have to pick up a case now I m I may sound crazy to you but I'm not 
 wha 
 yeah the background of my problem is that I have to pick up a case  I don't know what's in the contents of the case  I don't know what's in with it I don't know I don't I have a I don't have a vision it could have a bomb in it y I mean it could have a bomb I pick up the case I could blow myself up I don't know but all I know is that I've picked up this case once before but it sounds crazy I know I must be I know that I've got paranoid schizophrenia I know but yet again it was true y I mean and that will case will solve my problems and I run off with this girl we get married I'm telling the truth but people don't believe me y I mean I'm very I'm very I'm upset I'm a very angry man I'm upset and I'm very disappointed in this person this f certain indi s v individual because she comes along to me and said to me oh well the reason why I have to do this y know what I and do that no she's not because she doesn't care 
 cos she was   
 y I mean ah 
 some answers exactly 
 on what's really going on with my life what's going on I'm I wake up feeling the same way every day can't breathe I can't breathe and this person does not care I've just turned fifty-five and I'm still going through the same situation every day I feel numb I can't think and when I think and I listen people have a problem they get upset when it's got nothing to do with them I'm a very angry man because of what I'm going through and nobody cares you're looking at me posh well how can you do that to a playing with someone's sanity take away someone's sanity and expect them to be all mm ah happy you mean 
 that's wrong man playing with my feelings playing playing playing playing I know that I feel numb but then she's starts everything playing with my feelings an my emotions cos she has a an influence she has control over what's going on it's not fair that's why I'm hurt sometimes I feel hurt but I feel numb but I'm hurt I'm hurt it's not fair on me man  
 it's not look I wanna cry but it's not fair it's not fair on me it isn't er I have problems I have problems and no one cares that's why I got my own problems I have to try and think to use my head to survive in life and all I got left is   and my music I've got nothing I work with people who understand mental illness I've got nothing nothing at all I have nothing I'm sorry it's not fair you don't do that to somebody it's it's not fair you don't do that to somebody and yet expect them to run off and get married and y I mean 
  I know it's not your problems  what's your name 
   I know it's not your problems   I know but there's a lot of p mm there's people who are mentally ill who know what they are doing y I mean 
 I'm mentally ill but I don't know what I am doing that's what I'm trying to say I just want my sanity back I want   back I want to li get on because I know I faced up to reality before and they giveth and they take it away again cos they see something good inside me y I mean and all people want to do is play mind games and I'm very aware of mind games because it's a dangerous thing even people in prison in the hospital environment they don't care they do not care they don't give a damn all they care about is the money y I mean and if you know what you're doing you know where you stand with these people they wouldn't bother you that's why you've got to listen to bless yourself and other people you have to listen but people have a problem look even my family don't give a the only person that gives a damn about me is probably my mother you know like she doesn't understand mental illness as well I been going through this since since the nineteen eighties I got problems I have problems and I want to think and listen to solve those problems I have to I have my reasons I have my reasons I keep saying I have my reason why I have to listen because I've got problems and nobody cares nobody cares that's what I'm trying to oh that's what gets me angry y life has never stopped for me what is the difference between me and anybody else y I mean and these people seem to have a problem with me listening when I listen they don't like it they get upset when the wind blows in your nose your nostrils they don't like it they get upset s  they watch you in your face  that is mind games that's mind games 
 as I said we all breathe the same air but we are all different y I mean 
 I'm not fighty I'm not close I'm just expressing how I feel inside that's all I'm saying 
 it's easy to be misunderstood I just talked to someone to lo give me back what belongs to me and I could s talk about my problems and maybe I could like write a book on it 
 ah 
 I would yeah 
 yeah I should write a book and this is something about spiritually I should write a book on what I've been through in my life I'm  fifty fear five years of age  and I'm still going y know because of one individual  one individual messing me  I don't know who it is I don't know who's messing me about I've I don't know who it is I don't know what if there's light at the end of the tunnel I don't know it's the same way I feel every day I I don't know who the e ah I don't know who's doing this I don't know if it's my family because of jealousy and env  just because you're jealous and envy I don't know  I don't know who it is I can't pinpoint it I can't find the answers and that's why I want someone to listen to me y I mean because people don't care it's not fair i y you don't do that to somebody and then respect the the then they want respect y I mean I'm upset I'm angry I'm I'm really angry because of what I'm going through 
 I'm a human being I am a human being 
 I'm crying but I don't have no feelings that's what I do 
 ah 
 mean what 
 I have no feelings like none I have no feelings I'm sure you woulda I'm sure you ah I don't know why you never answer that question why you asking that quest cos y know I'm I thought you woulda understood you see you didn't understand you're not listening to what I'm trying to say you asked me how I'm doing and see that's that's all I ever get with people I have no feelings sir I don't have no feelings  I have any feelings  I don't have no emotions  they've tooken it away from me  I can't breathe y I mean I cannot breathe y know I can't breathe to solve my problems I can't I cannot breathe I want fresh air do you un  it make a lot of difference y I mean  
 it will make a lot a lot of difference I will feel better because I've been through this situation before and it is a bloody good feeling it was a good feeling I felt proper and  I felt clean hands clean h ah clean heart clean hands  dunno 
 it's not fair it is not fair  and I may I may edit I may write a book  if I get through this problem if I get through this problem that I'm going through but every day I wake up feeling the same way every day  because of one person basically don't give a damn all she concerns about is whatever's in the case  that's all she's concerned about she doesn't care about my damn situation she doesn't care y I mean all she wants me to do is pick up this case and play mind games with my head an expect me to run off and get married after what she's done to me ridiculous you don't behave like that man I'm crying but I don't have no feelings y I mean I'm crying from the top of my head y I mean that's why I don't I don't want nothing to do with people y I mean I don't want nothing to do with people cos I don't have the time for this crap I don't have the time for this rubbish y I mean if I if I was I'm a good-willed person I an if I wasn't alright s I would not have cooperated with you people y I mean just like anybody else I wouldn't have I would have compromised because I'm getting used and abused y I mean people take advantage y I mean and they exactly  the one they they that take advantage they exactly know what they're doing  when they're playing their mind games  they exactly know what they're doing  they know what they're doing they know what they're doing I don't know what I'm gonna do with my life my life is a shambles it's a shambles and I got to try and sort my shambles out I got my own problems I have my own problems and I aint got time for people who want to play mind games I just wanna get on with my life that's all I wanna do and all I got in my life is my music music is my J O B y I mean I could do other things I can learn other things but you have to use your brains and you must listen to speak to people to who advise you to use your brains to learn from that y I mean 
 I could be it if they want y know I could do it if they allow me to do it if they allow y they allow me to get on with my life I would do it with my life but because the people are so jealous and envious they y I mean every why is it every Monday morning that people have a problem a Monday morning Down's syndrome why is it I won't stay too long because I gotta try and make make breakfast for my mum yeah

 y I mean 
 peace of mind that's all I want peace of mind 
  yeah money's not a issue  because when you when you you're born with money you could have it when you die you can't take it with you we all have to die we all have to die we all have to die at the end of the day and that's what you gotta face up to well look I gotta go yeah

 because I'm not getting any signals you know why I'm not getting no signals from you 
 right because I don't feel nothing to get  singles from you signals  I'm I I I 
 because I can't face up to reality the reason why I can't face up I have no feelings 
 and I'm a very very good listener a very good I am I've met some people that I should not have met in the first place when I was in   hospital and   hospital yeah I was an I mean I was stupid I was stupid because you know why I was stupid I didn't think I'm sure that if I had thought I woulda been a different person I woulda if I did lea use my head and listen  I would never been in this  predictament   I would never been a mentally ill person believe me I would never have been a mentally ill person which I'm mentally ill I have a I admit it but I don't in some ways I doubt it if it's you know  why I doubting it  becau mm  people in authority haven't got a clue what they doing  they say they could look after your interests right right they haven't got a clue how a person feels at the end of their  as long as they'll get their doctors nurses social securities  even including your job you get paid for doing a job mm  and when they get paid for together  this is what I'm trying they get happy and they're alright they don't care about the feelings of people I mm that's why I'm the guinea we I have we are the guinea pigs we have to take the medication if you  if I was to give you the medication right  you have a mother don't you 
 you have a mother which is right but if I was to give you the medication now right would you take it

 exactly I coulda refused to take it there's a lot of people that took medication have  spitted  out the that that  spitted  it out patients in   hospital and   because the the nursing staff do not care no they don't care as long as they get paid and they give the people lip they're not gonna take the medication it's unfair man it's unfair I  corroprerated  but I was a fool I was a fool to cooperate  I should never cooperated  because you know if I did think I would not have  corroperated  y I mean you know y know 
 I've seen people right in   hospital it's ridiculous normal people they can't get sex they turn gay y I mean they're gay I didn't turn gay because I wasn't desperate for it y I mean  normal people who like woman  it got so bad it got so bad that they turned gay see that's what things that's what things do to you you know I'm sorry and I am not picking up no case until I think about what I'm doing before I pick up that case you know I met the likes of   I've met the likes of   them people  there are far more worse than me people  say to me I should never have been in them hospitals  I should never been  I should never have been in that situation there yet again the reason why I was there I did not listen and I did not think to listen it's bec it's rubbish it's a load of crap it's crap well look I've gotta go now because my mum is gonna get very upset with me in a minute y I mean 
 I wanna talk to you if if you have feelings show that you cos I'm not getting any signals from you y I mean you're not gonna solve my problems believe me you're not going to solve my problems you're not because if you do care show that you care because at the end of the when you walk away from this you've gotta get on with what you're doing the next time we're gonna meet is probably next year and the next time we pr er whenever if well probably next year I hope I get paid for it well I'm not interested about the money except it would help y I mean

 r right well what it's erm o on my computer mm mostly I I like I'm I do websites as well but it goes on and on and on but erm I've been writing songs for maybe ten years now something like that and I I used to write poetry but w I in I wasn't really like into it it's always been like songwriting that I've done so it's like erm like it every other line rhymes as as a song does that kinda ring so erm I haven't published my work or anything but I have it all saved on my computer erm so it erm I wrote a poem yesterday with like first time in quite a long time but it it it's mostly songwriting erm that I do so erm erm p I'd say apart from that it's like when I er when I blog on my on the website I build erm I blog as well but that's just like general prose like just general language stuff it's not poetic or anything but erm yeah I was inspired yesterday   to write a poem so but that's like the first in quite a while so it's mostly it has been songwriting and erm so er er what it's mostly it is like programming and some graphic design erm like I create er PNGs files and JPEG files erm and I put code over the top of that for people to m like to make it interactive on the website and mm or whatever it is 
 so but that it it that is about it really that is about it so I write a poem   it's the first time in a long long time but it is mostly songwriting that I get creative with so 
 right erm I do think that's my what's so good with erm I used to struggle for ideas with poetry whereas like songwriting it's like erm so like like every other line rhymes so it's like kinda structured what I do is erm I I use Wordpad on Windows and I n I need a word processor to do this I can't er l I I'm not I I I wrote a song quite a few months ago but I haven't my my computer was down erm I wrote a bl I can write with pencil and paper erm I tweak and tweak and tweak I hone it and hone it erm sometimes I just write it I er and like the  first's line gotta be taken out  and completely redone about ten mintues later or something so I need a word processor but erm and what I do is I I I'm like it's the kind of thing my brain I I I write each line and they have to be er the same width across so I get a piece of paper like a straight line like an A4 piece of paper on the mm w on the mm computer monitor so that erm they all line up erm vertically s like erm each each line vertically is like is the same width horizontally erm so it's kinda like er constraints that seems to be the way I'd get it out myself it's like its like that erm so with with poetry I I used to I used to write some poems that erm it really is more song writing and I'm  I'm   write  a song I will I should really start sending my work and everything but erm I I dunno really like the the main thing for me is is programming I think and s graphic design but I absolutely love writing songs and poetry as well so erm apart from that I do like erm photography erm but th they're just like snaps like architecture erm er so like the the gherkin building that kind of thing erm in       in in the city of London that kind of thing 
 like good architecture that I like and er the   building that kind of thing erm so but mostly it it is it is now mostly programming that I do for like to be creative with and it's all er digital on on the computer erm so I I s I have like er USB pen drives in my computer and I save my data to that so er erm I don't I don't like using my laptop to go online with because of hacking reasons erm 
 erm I just use like an antivirus software but erm it were it would crash all the time for some reason I d er people hacking me or whatever I don't know but erm but m mostly it is programming but I like writing songs as well song lyrics and I've been listening to music for years and years and years erm all day every day for years so that's about it really that is about it 
 erm I so I like photography as well just taking like snapshots that kind of thing of anything erm in in London here here in   like the local park there's like a moat there's erm like the er reflections are really good really nice reflections especially in the autumn with the leaves that kind of thing erm so that's about it really er   so 
 yeah erm I I sorry 
 erm I I use erm what I do is erm I will I w I will build like a a single  PNG like what what w one moment one d is one way of doing it is to create many individual  PNG files like logo and whatever digital art on it erm er MP4   on it whatever that's what I do so erm and erm so I I you you can do it like either like each  PNG individually or a I prefer to create one overall  PNG wi mm with like then it's divided into maybe ten different areas so erm to l I to do that with HTML and Javascript you have to erm use like a coordinate system when the user clicks on the i on the i on the on the  PNG the larger PNG if it's like a mobile website it could be like like the header erm so you'd have like the the logo on there and then like all the various channels or areas that are available to the person browsing the website on their mobile phone so I like to create this one single PNG but erm you can do l you can use put erm hotspots on it which is again is like a map kind of a coordinate system so you when the person browsing it clicks somewhere on the on the  PNG it's divided into several hotspots that takes them to like whatever it you have to take them to to another web page HREF erm like like an a   in HTML and that will take them to like another webpage so you you you can either do it I I I prefer to do it one single PNG or maybe ten or twelve PNGs whatever divide all put together so and so on erm Javascript makes websites interactive for the person browsing them erm so it's a erm without without j it's like the programmining language of the internet erm without Javascript th it's just or it or it or even you can do like single PNG files erm so the it what wh when it's er and they're they're called frameworks and it's like JQuery which is a Javascript framework erm there's ReactJS and ViewJS as well which are much newer and more popular now but I I prefer to use JQuery and so you get like the top left hand corner of the image er it's a coordinate system placed on the webpage and then you like if if the user clicks the mouse within a certain coordinate square or rectangle then that triggers that fires erm whatever it's g it has to trigger or fire whether it goes whether that goes to another webpage or it could make could hide or show that that element or anything like that so that is like kind of overlayered on top of the p on top of the graphic design so you got the webpage you got the graphic design and then you got the coding on top of that and erm so you have to deal with all that but erm what I do is I I copy and paste most things cos I got terrible brain brain fade so I b  I build like maybe like a toolkit could call it  erm with like various methods and whatever and JQuery code so I I have because of brain fade I have to have er copy and paste it but it's not really a hinderance at all to me erm like do I prefer to do it that way so you're reusing code so you can copy code from one file one Javascript file into another and then just change it al al erm alter it tweak it erm by either the position of where you're reading the user's click on the on the screen when I when I even erm I do like my own click for a mouse or a trackpad and I do erm touching for like mobile or touchscreen devices erm which is like erm like a er a smartphone like a iOS smartphone or an android smartphone er Apple or Google that kind of thing so so you're doing like so you got like the the webpage and you got the the visual art graphic design you got the coding on top of that and erm that's the way it works so th th that's what I do but erm in recent years I'm mm mm most of what I've done is programming now erm a away from poetry but I still write songs quite often so erm and erm I I have  I've got like hundred songs I've written  and all saved on my computer so erm  I used still write  in like wide sc wide er long sen sentences erm horizontally and I've chopped that down to like er what I call narrow format it's more pointed for people erm er makes it more zippy I think erm so that's what er I used to write I used mm maybe mm half way across the word the word processor screen now maybe only about a third across as I say I I get I have to get like a sheet of paper as a straight line and everything has to line up erm that's what I'm kind of stuck with but that's that the way it gets it out of me so erm th th that is about it but r say like it it it is mostly programming that I do so erm  
 erm you you what what I I er erm you can set like margins you can set like a right margin erm what is mm w within the within the er the mm er the wording you can put like break lines like BR for break erm or you can set like a right margin and erm without putting in line breaks and the s the software whatever it is does it for you so that it it erm right justifies erm so it comes down the sike on like on like a line lower so like that so that that is erm I I use er in within JQuery I use right margin now I used to use line breaks erm so there'd be like you know like er w HTML tags erm you get like a small   and then a bigger   and you put the maybe it's a DIV a divider in between those or like BR for line break like I'm talking about erm and I I worked out that it's better to do it without line breaks you just put in a right margin so you type from left left across to right as you would normally and erm but it at when it gets to the right margin it starts a new line for you without you having to do it so a a a a all you do there is you just you maybe type an entire paragraph and it cos you set a right Martin right margin it does it all for you whereas the other way of doing it is individual line breaks er BR tags 
 right erm erm 
 it it it erm it works for me definitely erm it it definitely works erm right so it   like it erm on like a practical level erm if you're doing like line breaks you gotta keep checking the code cos erm I hand code I don't don't use a design view I use h erm I hand code with er Netbeans which is like the main software that I use erm at s it's freely available on the internet you can download it for free and use it erm so it's it's only a code view it's not design view erm say like in Dreamweaver you have you have design view and code view and erm with Netbeans you only get code view erm there's a there's more software called er CoffeeCup which again is design view as well but I I just have code view so if you're doing line breaks without the right margin point you gotta keep checking it so w erm how it displays within the browser because it it er the entire thing is about the browser erm that that is the client it's called client side rather than server side it's called client side and I am client side if you do server side that's more for like people's accounts and like usernames passwords that kind of thing erm that and that   backend I do client side which is front end so on a practical level the if you're putting the right margin you can type as much as you want and erm on on the on the on the screen itself not not on on the webpage on the screen itself on the monitor erm it does like you can set it to like er er word wrap so it it gets to the right side of the monitor the line there it it'll word wrap for you so erm so I say on a practical level if it's just like er you can write an entire paragraph without having to put any line breaks in you set a right margin and that'll do the line breaks for you so it does make it it is a big it's usually important yes and that's that's the that's like the   on on the webpage and what I see on the monitor that's connected to the laptop I use so that that works with both for the web webpage and for when I'm sat in front of the the computer write writing all this stuff erm so yeah it definitely makes a difference but erm er in terms of like compared to like the the poetry with the song writing I don't know cos I don't it just gets it out of me with the song writing erm the pages I put a straight line down the right hand side and everything has to line up so erm so I u I used I used to make make the the verses the same width as the chorus then I went to narrow format like all narrow format and erm it's definitely more zippy I dunno more erm pointed I think for people gets the gets the point across a bit better I think rather than er rambling on for maybe another four or five words or something per line erm so I s I suppose I s it's  I did used to  or all the same erm words quite often but erm I like to like be like quite creative in within the creativity as well erm when you read er something that's like mm makes a bit more ambient I suppose for people to read erm so erm so I it   erm in er with JQuery Javascript I I learned that s i you I have to erm put in a right margin and it does all the line formatting justifying for you so erm you've just gotta make sure you don't overspill it might be on top of like a a plain piece of colour or something or another PNG or something so you could like on the right it could go to maybe ten lines or something and that could be like too much wording too too many words too much content for the the er the   that it's created inside erm 
 but so but but that's but the the main thing is definitely writing poetry and writing songs it er it it r it r it has to be o r erm aligned v v v vertically for me   so that that that definitely does it so 
 erm so I dunno what's going on with my brain but erm erm well on a pragmatic level practical level it's definitely   everything has to line up erm er erm I sometimes I I I might use like a couple words from somebody else's song like a popular song or something erm 
 erm so like you know it's not like erm plagiarism but erm erm might it might be like a phrase or something from a song that might use a couple words from that to put it in to make things more dynamic maybe I dunno but so erm that's it er er you know I definitely s s   seem to   like that when I'm in confined there's like structure and confinement that kind of thing I dunno if that's around me or in in me I don't know but erm so th the main thing I really do now now now is is programming and erm erm erm I I'm with with HTML erm you divide it you divide you got like the HTML within that you got the header area and the body area erm so I read that you know from people just starting out with programming HTML building websites it is the programming it's a markup language not a programming language but it's still the most important thing on the internet is HTML it that creates and structures everything 
 erm so er what I read was that p people at the beginning they put in loads of DIVs dividers erm and it was I read this on somebody's blog or something that it is known as erm DIV soup so 
 so I decided   to not put in that many DIVs but it turns out you have to put in a lot of DIVs you really have to divide the page up you got like a wrapper erm which wraps the entire content of the of the body area y g you got the header and the body and you have to work with the body erm so so I read erm and erm so now I gather up loads of DIVs it is it's like structure and form erm and it's when you when you're looking at it it's easy to understand what's going on with the code  cos er terrible brain fade  erm so you got like erm DIVs and  within them with inside that  you have P tags for like paragraph that's like text and words you got IMG for images that could be anything a photo a JPEG a  PNG a GF whatever people have erm so I I d I really love HTML and it's divided up into bitesize chunks on the page on the computer that I I look at erm so erm yep so that that could be more of the same thing I don't know what's going on in my brain but erm it's def w when there's like it's organised and erm succinct maybe I dunno erm but definitely g that definitely helps me being creative with it I suppose alright 
 can I just cos  it's bit erm  for a couple of minutes my computer's just er gone into screensaver I'll be back in a minute 
 yep so erm that that definitely sparks some kind of creativity in me I think but and it's on a practical level it's it's mm erm easier to understand and it's divided up quite nicely erm erm there's like some someone said if it's like scope for like variables if you're in the progamming in the Javascript you have like erm scope S C O P E and erm I I used to like sometimes put like the variables midway down the code down the page but it turns out they all have to go at the top if you put them at the top you get full scope down throughout like erm talking like functions sort of like on a on a Javascript page in inside a function you p you p you have to put all the variables at the top erm there's there's something called linting lint which they got the word from hint they got er and they changed it to lint and you just erm on the page that you're on there erm when you're coding you can lint and it it marks up in red erm the error that you've made so I I used to put the variables at the like the main necessary variables like as as I was using them going down the page as I code top to bottom top down to bottom so erm turns out that it all has to go at the top and I much prefer that as well so but erm I mean there are thing the main thing is definitely in er with writing songs and it   everything has to be right aligned on the right side it erm vertically aligned each line going across each sentence going across so erm erm and that is like I've I've done that for many many years now and that's the only way I can do it really if erm if I don't do it that way then then I don't know it's er it's the unknown I think erm so I think I prefer to use the known   rather than the unknown 
 in terms of like structure and th the form that kind of thing er and th w er this is w obviously on a computer display on a monitor erm that I use so erm erm after that like ah like erm Andrew Motion the erm ah former er poet laureate that kind of thing er  
 couple an a line or so from one of one of his poems that kind of thing erm is in me as well erm but it's mostly more music than anything else 
 well erm so I dun I dunno what's going on   in in my brain I don't know but erm erm er so it r erm like I l I like where I come from like is that is that erm I was abused as a child this kind of thing erm erm so I mean er th that's what I used to hear in my voice in in my head sorry like voices in my head so this kind of thing erm so but I was told I wasn't erm but what came er I as when this first happened again er when schizophrenia first happened the mental condition that I have happened psychosis erm that is what I had that I'd been badly abused as a child and was like tied up that kind of thing so erm 
 but I get told that I wasn't so erm so this is what this is like the the schizophrenia the psychosis that I have that I've been diagno diagnosed with so erm so I dunno I know I dunno what is going on in my head I don't know but that definitely gets it out of me and I love writing songs and writing poetry and being poetic as well erm but like all the years it's been music erm rather than poetry it's al it's always been music popular music erm so contemporary hit music er adult   rock music that kind of thing erm so erm I was like s about eighteen years ago now I was diagnosed with schizophrenia erm so that's what I've been living with ev like ever since and erm w I I thought it I thought it might be like erm autism that kind of thing but I was told no it's definitely schizophrenia erm so with people that have schizophrenia I dun we people that may maybe have erm aspergers they're more creative and I took park in took part in a walking group erm like a once a week walking group this is erm about 2014 I think and erm I one on the one of the blokes there on on on er within the group was like creative as well he was doing websites as well and I said to him you know is it something to do with schizophrenia that makes people more creative or not erm I don't know erm so but I've been told that I was not abused erm but it that's y w when when it first started for me this is the first thing that came back to me basically I been badly abused as a as a very young kid you know as a baby so erm 
 erm I dunno if it's like frustration or I dunno erm s erm erm like one of the w one of the hardest things that I I've always struggled with is that trying to say my own name to people erm that could be like going for like going for like er like my blood tests just stuttering erm for c c c cl clozaril erm er so that's had a like profound effect on me as well is like stuttering about to say my name er f erm it is absolutely terrible at times erm so that that's al when   I can do that kind of thing so I'm I'm stuck here in indoors on my own all I have now is is my computer erm to express myself and whatever erm like the perfect thing for it is the internet is a website erm in this day and age erm so er so I dunno er b erm m b er m don't like I er operate better when I'm confined there are limitations erm that kind of thing maybe so 
 erm yeah 
 is that what 
 sorry 
 erm 
 I erm could be may erm that erm erm if I if I hadn't hadn't had all this erm like say like bad stuff in I I say like my my brain used to freak er my brain used to freak out one on one with people especially I I it would be great maybe working in a job centre interviewing people all day but erm I can't really do that kind of work erm erm like interpersonal relations are an absolute nightmare for me erm getting on w people when   is absolutely terrible erm I'm much better left alone I think to my own devices and erm so that's er this stuff is is in me for a reason  when I first had the er schizophrenia I see  i mm er I'm what as my brain was saying that had been done to me it must w h how would it be my brain if it hadn't been done to me erm so erm I say well no it's not real so erm so th erm b mixing with people's absolutely terrible most of the time so b mm when I did the walking group erm like the bloke that was into computers as well I mean we h we hit it off straight away erm everything's like it's been like about six week once a week for about six weeks and it always like we went to erm the erm er er th th d th the d d the done the dondon the th d the London Olympic Site and erm all the way we were talking about computers and this kind of thing erm so I got on really well with him but erm that's like all tech stuff like techie stuff erm internet and apple iOS and everything so erm I I was like it I'm terrible with that kind of thing with like mixing with people and until you give me something to erm chew on like that you know something and like with him it was like computers so imme it immediately becomes OK erm but without that I can like people around me like w er I went to my father's erm birthday thing  a couple of year ago  and er you know basically spoke to two people all night twice er everyone's like around me is chit chat you know chatting away to each other having fun and   erm erm and I I'm sat there you know all that's going through my head er erm erm so mixing with people is absolutely terrible and and conversation is until I get to know somebody a bit and erm there's like some kind of topic to go on erm that p I'm mm it's probably not just me but erm that's what I've had so so it would've been great to have been like erm when I was younger to have been like you know more confident that kind of thing erm so erm it is an absolute nightmare for me erm to get along with people and to mix with people that kind of thing and until I get to know people and at the same time I've got like erm almost like poetry going off as well at times song lyrics and programming and everything so which most people are not really into I suppose erm so that makes things difficult as well I guess so  
 yeah right yeah well erm so like erm I'm I'm really happy to be myself I'm really I'm really really happy to be me so erm I've never been like one of the boys that kind of thing erm so erm like erm I come from like a working class background erm in   yeah so erm so it mm erm not generalising or anything or stereotyping but it does I've it all has been a bit different so erm erm er like I I   being creative that's the main thing it's being creative if I'm not being creative I'm prowling round the room looking for things to do 
 erm so being creative definitely definitely helps me completely I think erm what so what I really wanna do is learn and teach and that means a website erm to teach people how to code themselves and erm get more out of life I suppose erm so er 
 I I definitely wanna share this with people definitely and and saying the id the ideal thing is a website I think so 
 yeah I'm hand hand coding completely from scratch I I say I I use Netbeans erm which is really good software so er it's or er IDE er integrated development environment erm so erm it's it's absolutely free and it's really really good software and that's that's my main thing now apart from that it's like a word processor something like Wordpad that's built into Windows erm I use that to write to write songs with and poetry with erm so erm that that's definite I'd tried pencil and paper and you gotta keep rubbing stuff out ob obviously erm putting lines through stuff and making amends so with Wordpad it just use like the er delete button the backspace button whatever and it's job done so 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 well erm erm it erm I suppose it's erm it's like erm like to like with the with the with the code I use like the same er techniques over and over again so so I I I do like I might might my main thing is like like I said to you before is like copy and paste kind of look on things erm so with the   so you copy and paste an entire chunk of code onto into a different file or a different function within the file erm and just make minor alterations to it erm I w I'm trying to build games as well and when when they build you know these video games the player can maybe take twenty minutes to go through a a whole  a whole section of the game that might take them six months to build it  
 erm so with with what I do that's like you know like proper video games erm th you know cost millions of pounds to develop erm I I I try to take like the opposite erm approach to that whereby I maybe create a a whole section of code in maybe two days or something and it'll be give the player like four months of of gameplay 
 erm so like doing it the opposite way round like w when they build like big big video games obviously you got like the graphics you got the audio er the scripting the writing everything erm graphic design I suppose as well and it could take er it er a game could take three three and a half years to develop so er I t I what I've gone for is is like is like the opposite of that so it's like copy and paste or there's like refactor erm in Netbeans and there's like other software called erm Eclipse which is free as well and that's for coding as well in Java Javascript erm and erm so   I've forgotten what I was gonna say now   so erm er in that way to to reuse the code that kind of thing erm so erm you can refactor erm there's like w with refactoring you you can rename erm you can copy you can move you can delete erm various content er so that's what I I do like I copy and paste so I've I've got like erm ex existing files er Javascript files er er for the code so I start a new file for a another purpose another reason within the website or the game on the website and erm so I copy and paste a lot so with like the brain fade that I have it's not actually terrible brain fade but it it is not the best so erm so in that way that is definitely copying and pasting and and recycling code reusing code I mean like years ago I read erm a C++ erm you can do whatever you want with it erm in terms of programming and erm they reuse the code so that that's what I tried to do it makes it it erm I I copy and paste all the time if if you sit there writing it it erm for me it'd be impossible you an entire page worths of code could take like er two hours to write or something so you copy and paste it it's done in like three seconds and then you just make alterations to it 
   whatever it's gotta gotta do so that that definitely speeds things up definitely erm so erm I do that all the time let's say erm there's like erm within Netbeans there's like finding projects erm me there like a menu the edit menu and bottom of that there's like finding projects so y that opens up a like a panel and you type in what you wanna find and where you wannna find it in oth in other open projects or within the same project and in the second  it's it's comes out  you know all nicely structured for you where w what what file it's in what line it's on that kind of thing so you just click on that and that that takes you to the file where it is on and then copy and paste it from there back into where you wanna copy and paste it so that is an absolute boon copy and paste and erm er refactor copy as well but erm it's line er control a to select everything A for all A L L and then there's control V for paste s erm control V for copy for paste in the same position and so like that is that is an an an absolute boon it's copy and paste erm when I'm coding so erm but I do like erm what I really do is erm wording erm erm that you can like you can check what erm it it's like k kind of created like quite randomly erm but it c erm and I I I go to like erm there's like erm a sys like a the the game I'm trying to build like is space based but then it's like they're like science fiction and role playing games like er er MMORPG like a little grind 
 and er er so I I kind of like have a system called maelstrom erm and within that you've you've got like how many erm space docks there are trade docks space docks erm what's what's the right er vendors er v v v v v v v v v v v v vendors erm that buy and sell erm so that kind of thing so erm but yeah a absolutely copy and paste it makes life much much easier when you when you're coding I I recommend that to people definitely rather than type er mm hand typing every single page it'll take for absolutely forever erm so erm I I do that all the time copy and paste within programming that's within Netbeans and erm I use PyCharm w er for Python that's free again it's very very good software so erm that's free again it's erm built by a company called   they they had like a paid version of it but the free version's very very good it's like you get almost all the same options and whatever erm and it is it is absolutely free they they update it maybe three or four times a year so you just download it and install it and erm start a new project or er open an ex an existing project into it erm so there's like Netbeans erm Eclipse and er PyCharm all free  of  er absolutely free and very very good software built so  if I was like I'm am building a website  and people wanna learn and teach want me to learn and teach the m the main thing like  the software that the IDE that they'd be using are absolutely free  erm there's erm s doing just web design not not coding as such like erm like the real hands on kind of coding that I do with with er Javascript JQuery s like CoffeeCup erm which is free as well erm th the it there is like a fully paid version but they do a free version as well so you just need to start and account with them and you can download it and use it and that's for creating websites as well  but there's not much not much hands on code thing  with it erm it's like drag and drop that kind of thing mostly so but erm so there there's like Netbeans Eclipse and PyCharm that I would recommend so absolutely d f the the main thing with me is I use it to learn and teach definitely and erm it's like I need I need an audience so er er as   I know I get like sixty hits a day within twenty four hours that'd that'd be absolutely fine erm at like at like the out the outset that that'd be absolutely fine so erm but I mean and I think erm within coding you got like the syntax and obviously whatever goes in strings erm like quotation    can do anything you want it so you're dealing with like  syntax which is like a function like there's like there's like functional er a procedural way of doing it and then there's like OOP object orientated programming way of doing it so erm I mostly do functional procedural erm with Javascript with Java I learnt Java first and I used to do er OOP but erm I much prefer functional it's eas it er not easy to do but it's probably more straightfoward I think erm so it gets the job done again so but yeah that that that is mostly it it is for me it is programming I think that is  that is mostly well it to be creative so like  
 yeah I've used Notepad++ 
 erm er 
 it's only about a ten megabyte install so it's much smaller but erm th er it is like   and er tidy as well to tidy up the code but I need an a IDE I'm er I I have dabbled with erm Notepad++ erm  they got folder as a workspace  erm FAW erm that they introduced into it that's that's very very good erm and obviously you can set er  probably only set any language you want  Javascript or Java erm HTML CSS erm so erm I I I definitely need an need an an IDE and but Netbeans is very very good and it's obviously again it's free completely free it's just like it's like a simple download erm and it installs in a minute if that so erm and you put in plugins as well so like tidy tidies up the code and er   I was talking about before about linting erm it 
 points out the errors in your code that h that's very very helpful as well so but erm I mean for me it erm it is it is definitely er Netbeans is is my favourite so so it it it's about like er three hundred and fifty megabyte download versus ten megabytes for Notepad++ so and it takes up a lot more system resources as well like er Netbeans so n er n er Notepad++ on the other hand is only like ten megabytes or something erm er Notepad++ takes like a huge amount of like system resources I've   got erm like well on the laptop I have it's like eight gigabyte erm of ram in it erm which I recommend if you're using like it's it's a collosal piece of software and it takes up like a huge amount of space in in system resources so erm I I do like Notepad++ though but I definitely need an er an IDE so 
 yeah yeah yeah yeah well er just   through in my head here my main thing is like the the er cello the instrument the cello and concrete erm   erm which I don't it was like a cellist many many years ago and he was on BBC television I think on a Saturday night and it's like the cello coupled with concrete in London it could be the Barbican or something but that kind of thing erm but erm so er 
 I mean that that's when it comes to something is like it is I can't play the cello at all er I can't play any instruments but erm erm I absolutely love concrete like the   gallery and the Barbican erm the Southbank erm so er two of the things that are in me I think is cello the cello and th er and concrete at the the this is I I this is what I have in my head this is what I h this is what I have so it's the way it goes so 
 right right it's er the erm violin family erm of instruments it's like four there's like no hole in the on your neck or like they sit it sit down with it and play it with concrete sorry erm I I like glass as well and maybe metal but th def er def my favourite I won't say that I used to say to myself like that erm like with like photography that I do erm absolutely none of it is closed for I don't pay for like models or anything like that usually hack it out with with the camera to the Barbican again or anywhere   maybe erm these kind of places but erm like the Barbican is profoundly concrete erm maybe like pebbledashed a bit but it's it is concrete and like the tiled floor on like the podium level erm but I say I said something about thank you to the architect and the builders the plumbers the labourers that worked on it those who erm I I love clouds as well and in in photos erm so I was saying before like erm   like the gherkin this kind of thing and the Lloyds building I used to I love the Lloyds building in   street in London erm with concrete I mean it's like oh er it's obviously it's like a rough material there's like a a Japanese architect   and he works in concrete used to work in concrete erm but the church is the light that he erm was the architect on that kind of thing erm a j they dr they drew like old erm holes in the concrete as well dunno why they er that's how they bolt it together or what I don't know but erm erm like th my favourite piece of concrete's probably the   gallery in the   it's conceptual I suppose erm erm like erm I I love like er   work erm the bricks that kind of thing cos it caused an absolute uproar back in the seventies erm but erm   I think erm that kind of thing erm erm I like erm i i erm installation artwork people's installation artwork   erm architect erm she built like er a er an inside out house she built where with like all like the fireplace where on the outside rather than on the inside erm she built like a a big kind of whatever they're called erm oh I forget the word but erm mm   fill it with concrete or whatever erm the mould erm so th t erm   sat there playing the cello like is very very creative I think and er er erm obviously it's audio but it's probably visual as well I dunno erm but th the that's er that's probably what it all probably comes down to is like that cello and concrete erm for me so erm 
 erm I I I I dabble a bit but only like macro erm kind of architecture like macro ideas not not micro erm so it erm 
 so erm I I I I I think erm I I I love erm photography I think that's what it is is is photography rather than like erm any aspiration to be an an architect but it definitely it is erm I love taking photographs as well so erm so erm I just use like a three time optical zoom camera and now have a big bridge camera it's like forty times zoom 
 erm af after lockdown goes I I wanna go out again with the camera I'm absolutely chomping at the bit to get out with the camera I might I might buy a new camera as well erm an a Nikon Coolpix camera I wanna buy so when Argos reopens erm maybe buy one buy a new camera but erm so it's like concrete and like m m quite like modern architecture like the   building erm erm so I feel like an absolute idiot with this but this is what I have so erm it's what I walk around with so erm erm like I I love taking photos but I'm not not erm not technically more composition erm so I don't like like as far as like aperture goes and F stops and all this kind of thing I don't really do I just erm use like the zoom and if it's just a photo now I take a photo I'm happy with that the composition I'll take the photo of it and I love getting the photos back home like they're on like a HD SD card obviously inside the camera and erm erm it's like with er digital photography it's  it's like you need it now in years ago you  you had to put it into a pharmacy into a chemist obviously your photos developed but now it's just something you like I go out in the back garden and two minutes later like the photo I've taken in the back garden is on my computer monitor erm it's like 
 erm completely immediate nowadays so I I   that as well and I use like Paintshop Pro to erm filter the photographs into black and white or whatever erm you use like   there's like you   and burn so you can emphasise mid mid tones or erm shadows that kind of thing so I use I use I use er burn burn shadows for most of my photos and it brings out they come out really really well erm there's like er software called Lightroom by Adobe which I don't have but that's that's pretty good software as well erm but I use er Paintshop Pro myself so erm that does graphic design as well you can you can build buttons and whatever within it as well so it's there like for photographers and graphic designers as well so but erm I absolutely love photography I really do so and so it just get yourself a camera and an oyster card and get yourself out aro out and about around London and take loads of photos I might take a h a hundred or a hundred and fifty photos or something in a few hours I used to do might be out with the camera 
 erm I've done a couple erm photography courses as well erm erm adult learning courses so I got like the erm cert erm two cert certificates for that and that is like mostly composition as well I think it's like just like basics really but erm composition some some technical as well but mostly composition so but that all comes together so the thing that   me is like erm like an end product there's a there has to be an end product like code or graphic design er or a photograph or whatever erm that's like the main thing as long as there's some kind of end end result for it so but that that's     so erm I've since being diagnosed with schizophrenia with psychosis erm erm so I been out like dozens of times with the camera around   London   London like     as well I like so erm I'd say like the   the Barbican the City of London     I like erm so y er and I get quite lucky with the clouds obviously when I'm out with the camera it's not raining that day like I don't wanna go out with the camera so  and I get so it's not raining  so I get like invariably I get clouds I used to get clouds which I really really like erm so erm what's driving it I don't know but that that is is what I have so it is what I do so 
 right right what I go for is like erm total composition erm I I call it so l it it everything within the photo is like   in the photo without having to crop it later or anything like that that so no no cropping and they say it's absolutely essential but erm so what I go for is like total composition  that  I call it so erm the the two things I have is like the megapixels on the camera which could be like twenty megapixels and erm so like the the optical zoom it used to be only three times the optical zoom I went to like eighteen times I think and now I have like forty times with the Bush camera that I have at the moment erm so er erm it er er I I go for like er total composition so it it er erm I I like putting people in   as well but that's that's something else erm   I've been called up once or twice by people by like erm I think w er   high street out erm and like the camera I took photo of a man working outside a shop and he's like putting stuff in in and out the shop being like er erm er like a d d d d d d d d d d d d delivery erm erm and like the flash went off and so he he saw that I was taking a photo of him I was like thirty yards away something like that and erm so he pulled me up about it but he was er w he w quite nice about it so but erm I like putting people in people in images as well erm erm but what I go for is total composition so erm just that everything in the photo is what I want and erm invariably you get like a blemish or something you get like something it could be anything like a a plastic bag on the ground or something that you don't want in the photo so in Paintshop Pro there's like a removal tool like a au au au automatic removal tool so you you just click on on the area that you want to remove and it removes it erm and re recreates around it erm like the the same content from around it so it blends in so it might b it could be like anything I mean like coke can  or something I dunno any could be anything  a plastic bag that they they don't want it  but erm apart from that I go for like total composition so erm s like and like in in Paintshop Pro the photos scrub they scrub up really really well like you know like people out there they they might like have a four or four thousand pound camera or something which I don't have I have like a hundred and eighty quid camera erm they might have like a four thousand pound Nikon or something erm like a DSLR which I don't have so I'm really happy with Paintshop Pro it scrubs the photos up very very well with like   and burn erm erm vibrancy you can add you can add er vibrancy to a photo er one of the things that are levelled against digital photography is that they're not very vibrant compared to film people still like using film erm so erm Paintshop Pro's very very good but erm definitely total composition and the m I love putting people in photos so erm invariably like my my people pictures are l like blurred where I just   with the camera quickly with the camera so they can't see that kind of thing   that you're taking a photo of them er which means it means they're kind of blurred so erm so there's there's that that's like if you're er   I mean people photography but erm definitely total composition erm like erm everything's in the photo is what I want to be in the photo and er crop it or anything resize it or crop it or anything so erm that seems to do it really so erm hold on I'll I'll just be about a couple a couple of seconds so erm yep erm erm I like taking photos of street signs as well er road signs street signs erm w whatever like the the roads around here   I like I like the back streets of   there's like erm for me there's like two there's like er   central station which does what it says I think it is the central station and erm there's like erm like the the   side of things is really quite quiet s like l erm leafy back streets almost and then there's like the s the the high street and the area going towards   erm which is much more colourful much more loud erm I think erm rather than just like   back streets there's like people actually out and about shopping and everything so erm so erm I I def I definitely like back streets of London w er and back streets of   as well erm but definitely er total composition definitely er like with photography and things like you know architecture and clouds in the image all of it so and people as well erm I used to like erm the thing I used to   was like street scenes street scenes erm be like er w erm many many years ago was like erm er urban seventy five website erm a bloke in   was done it and like he's like f photography is very very er inspirational very good erm photography of i the   area and I mean the   area as well erm erm he's I mean he he puts the photos up of   street station in     street station I think and then there was like erm like billboards and like torn posters on billboards this kind of thing all in black and white I think erm so that's what it's   like street scenes but erm and you know so I think concrete and cello   is it I think so 
 yeah 
 erm I think with with photography what what's out there is out there but erm I I always get told it's not what you take it's how you take it the the photograph erm erm whereas write writing a song maybe on a computer is like erm so like sometimes   I might borrow a lyric or two erm but apart from that it's mm like ground up erm it's just like a a blank screen within a word processor erm rather than something like the   building that is that exists already and it's really there erm so 
 erm erm I don't w erm maybe there's like content within content I dunno erm but again with the   building I I   up the   in   street erm it's like the outside in inside outside building or all like the erm the carcass and everything is on the outside rather than on the inside so erm maybe that is it I don't know erm   so erm erm maybe that that does it for me it gets me it erm like it er I'm not  sorry  who the architect was but I absolutely love his work and erm that could be it I think it er it erm   what's inside me is actually on the outside rather than on the inside could be erm so erm well I say with like with with the word processor erm this say er mm can you you borrow a lot like a few a couple words or something from another song and erm I erm with a song with songwriting like all is possible erm whereas with w erm so er with like the the er the photography courses that I er I I attended a few years ago erm but the teacher took me aside said she's quite happy with my work erm and she asked me like and like when I first joined the course and you're asked if you had any erm mental health problems and I said I put yeah I I have schizophrenia and er she took me aside one week and er said she like really likes my work how does my work come about is it because of schizophrenia the mental health problems I have so I wasn't er  I'm not sure erm that's say to me it it always felt  like it was like erm erm autism like asperger's but I r it really is schizophrenia it's schizophrenia that's the diagnosis spo erm she was like really happy with my work erm so that if it's yeah if that like things like like the   building that I absolutely love it so erm I erm so I dunno yeah erm 
 I was er I was there one day and erm I I think some some people react badly to being there with a camera some some people do react badly   to it I don't they don't erm why are you taking photos and this kind of thing erm like I went to   one day erm   and like a man stopped me at er working on a stall there he stopped asked asked me why I was taking photos so     in   so that's why I'm here taking photos erm so I don't know maybe it's erm this is what I have so erm so erm on its w er on the inside s why so maybe I put it on the outside like the   building erm so w er erm my my main thing is def is definitely at erm with photography is erm im erm i i i mean im imediacy so erm from like taking the photo two minutes later it's on on the laptop which is absolutely brilliant for me erm there's no like er er er there's no other erm overheads or costs or anything erm 
 like I went to erm like a film photog a film photography course as well which I which I stopped going to   erm I   enlarger and you got like emulsion and erm obviously you got like er dark room er that kind of thing I had n no idea what they were doing at first erm so I didn't feel part of that so erm I I dropped the course after a couple weeks erm say for me it is definitely erm digital photography and like immediacy but I think erm when I'm out there with the camera and I get some strange looks at time at times and that kind of thing and   they wanna know why I'm taking photos but this is what I have so erm maybe what's out there can express what's inside me so getting it out getting it out of me so when I take photos like maybe that gets it out of me every time erm ticks all the boxes that kind of thing w v er   the problems that I have so but erm but the main thing with it is definitely composition i with photography  rather than technical side  erm so on the erm photography course I went to   course I went to I was trying to think they were very very technical with it whereas me it's just like pointing the camera and is that a photo yes it is OK I'll take the photo of it I'm happy with what's in the frame so I'll take the photo of it like straight away erm and that that that that definitely works so erm so erm like the the photography I do I n n n n n n n n n n n n n none of it's prite posed for so erm I have to make the best of it myself so that means like people architecture buildings concrete everything so erm erm it it is what I have so erm but I think   is getting it out of me erm I  but the schizophrenia the psychosis will go or not I don't know  I presume it won't  but being creative I think i is i is definitely is definitely is being creative so erm I'm not being creative I'm prowling the bedroom prowling the room  like er things to do that kind of thing so erm so all all I have really is is my computer that's what it boils down to is my is my laptop computer it's all I have so it 
 so that that is it really but erm you know with with photography it's it's erm it's like I can't draw I can do graphic design this kind of thing I can do vectors erm vector artwork I use inkscape erm but I can't draw as such so with a camera I can compose do composition 
 so erm like people's front gardens I've got so l er  so I had to got  I have like a certain routine in   takes me along one of the the main backstreets into   park   park   park around the moat there's like the   art gallery there in er that park here in    
 and there's like the   garden s really like beautiful shops and flowers in it and that kind of thing erm so that's pretty good as well in the local area that we have and   forest is the London first London borough of culture last year I think erm so w we're quite lucky with that erm so er yeah brilliant it is it is it's definitely er creativity erm er erm it aint for I don't I get the the feeling it's only me that is like this I don't know so what other people have like I went went to like a a hearing voices group and erm I was it was I thought it was just me me and   hearing voices and everything it turns out you know my my my condition wasn't quite as bad as other people's in some ways erm so that er mm they they'd give like an an account of the past week  it was like we going once a week on a Friday  and they w they were like each   and you know there'd they'd all be hearing voices and erm I thought it was just me er er that kind of thing to that extent er so I think like with creativity th erm it's what I have really so erm s like keeps me occupied it keeps me sane I suppose erm th erm like I I don't I w care I don't know what other people have in their lives I don't know but erm mostly work I suppose ob obviously so but outside of work I don't know what other people have football erm which I do as well I do as well I do football as well erm but erm it is definitely creativity erm so so that s that s that s an an absolute eye opener when I went to the hearing voices group erm th that was in   as well and erm I people in quite a bad way so erm I I I love   as well the the local area here so we got like the park you got the high street the market in the high street erm good transport connections erm like the   gallery and   park itself back streets I like er it is erm quite working class I suppose so erm that's why erm erm so that that keeps me happy I suppose as well but erm it is definitely creativity so that's like at the moment that is programming mos mostly so erm 
 so so   I I could have like work family this kind of thing job all of it so when this is what I get I get like from I dunno if if it is schizophrenia I'm not sure but if it is it is this is what I get so erm so it may it it it can't be bad makes amends for the schizophrenia I suppose if it   if it   if it is the schizophrenia so 
 erm I used I used to do some work but erm erm like with coding it w it it's all come together in in erm I started learning Java in like about ten years ago and er I moved in HTML5 HTML just a couple of years ago I brought a book from er W H Smith er th er I put like everything together so like it like focused everything so it structured it everything again so like the HTML CSS and the Javascript the programming like like erm united everything together erm and erm so a but I most I I first started using er Paintshop Pro like about eighteen years ago now and erm   with photographs that kind of thing I used to like dabble with it with some web design but with like the programming on the programming erm I realised that like everything is like event driven that means like the person that on on the computer or on or the tablet that they have whatever so that means like a mouse they they they've got a mouse they can click they got a keyboard they can type and what's programmed into the software as well erm so that's like event driven so if they click a button then that sets that fires another method or a function whatever it is 
 so erm so in a way that's er  programming makes thing interactive  rather than just erm design view erm cos there's like code view right erm Javascript makes is the language of the web the main language of the web and it makes everything interactive for people erm so in th er erm I I I used to I I used to do some work but erm I mean erm like computers got quite a bit quite a bit cheaper and quite a bit better erm like CPUs and GPUs I mean the amount of system memory and internet speeds as well erm I used to use like a dial up modem that was like erm really really slow really very slow nowadays you have broadband huge download speeds everybody mm most people enjoy so erm I used to do some work but not like not like it is now but it all started I mean one Sunday evening I downloaded the JDK which is like the Java Development Kit and then Netbeans on on top of that that erm it melds into the to the JDK you you connect it with the JDK you set up like er managed platforms and erm you you y you pick what what you might have several JDKs installed or maybe just one and you decide which one you wanna use and they work together so that's like about ten years ago now so I've come on leaps and bounds since then but OOP and functions as well erm so erm I I used to I used to do some work but not not like now like erm it's all day every day now at at the computer so erm I d so I don't connect to the internet with using wifi erm for like hacking reasons if I get hacked or something I don't like it so I use like the tablet for the internet internet usage but erm I used to do some work er some photography I used to do back then back then I u I used it's more like film photography like thirty-five millimetre film photography erm with a scanner 
 erm like like erm like a f a like a photograph scanner so I would scan the i scan the photo into on in in onto the hard drive and use er Paintshop Pro to erm filter them and resize them whatever so but erm I'm definitely more productive today definitely erm so erm 
 right right w what it is erm like erm it builds erm like knowledge builds I think so erm and erm  knowledge needs to leads to knowledge  I think like like anything like money leads to money and I think knowledge leads to knowledge 
 and it builds so if if you've got like a ground in maybe maybe one one erm like in Paintshop Pro or whatever or Photoshop whatever then I think you can if you haven't used the other one then you can pick it up quite quickly I think erm so I I I say like erm that knowledge builds and the rich get richer and the poor get poorer is the thing so erm so erm w erm there I think definitely that erm it builds so ex experience and knowledge of like software like erm things like it's to learn your packages they used to say so it could be like Photoshop or or anything Netbeans Paintshop Pro whatever that people use erm is to learn your packages like this is like about twenty years ago and erm it was like a a a progam on TV on BBC2 again I think erm it's like th the outset of the internet erm s   things like dial up modems and compared to what we have now smartphones and everything that we have now it back it was quite primitive obviously so but erm they they film like one one episode about this man who w erm is there's like a like a music website back then erm dot music I can't remember erm and erm he was like a George Michael fan and he built er like a fan a fan website for George Michael and he said like you gotta learn the packages he applied to work at this music company but they they they turned him down he wasn't quite good enough for it but he in in that program they said he said like erm he said like you gotta learn your packages which is you have to do IE Photoshop or whatever it is erm Illustrator Adobe Illustrator like vectors erm so erm I i erm so if if you if you know how to program in one language erm it's OOP for instance object orientated programming erm you pick up the reigns quite quickly with another programming language erm so you know like ten years ago I started from w from w almost nothing I used to program in basic erm procedural basic rather than in Java so I had no idea at all I was googling it left right and centre erm there's like er for instance er rendering hints which y you know you can like er it applies like erm   into text maybe and so I I used to erm the techniques I used to use with erm basic I was applying to like OOP so I w I was googling it and I realised that then there's like two different kind of things erm so erm but erm it definitely like if you like it's it's like y erm I I say   if you learn how learn how to drive a car for instance you could be like a Sunday driver or you could be like in Formula One or something it depends what you do with it like so you you you learn how to program but it's what you do with it 
 erm so you could be like Sterling Moss or you could be like being on a Sunday or something Sunday driving it depends what you do with it so erm so there's that and then I think that knowledge builds definitely and anything leads to anything erm 
 and that's that's like that's like creative ideas or anything erm leads to anything so erm erm so that that has definitely happened I say erm I brought a book on HTML a couple of years ago and erm that's where it really really kicked off I think is with that book I paid like twelve pound for it or something in W H Smith erm that brought it all together like focused it all together into like one entity that I could use I E coding like learning how to use HTML CSS and Javascript and erm s like the software I use is like free it's like Netbeans and Inkscape erm I use I used to use Webplus when it s when s used to cost about eighty pound or something but erm it doesn't do like erm RWD responsive web design which is all the go nowadays cos it  everybody got a  different sized smartphone or tablet or whatever 
 so you have to do RWD erm there's something called media query erm which gets the size of the er display that the person's using and so you put your code inside of media query which adapts it to that display size erm so that's that's that's something I use all the time as well in that's in er cascading style sheets that like CSS erm erm that's all media query that's erm there's like something else called CSS grid which I've used a bit but I don't really like it so erm I I'm back with CSS and media query erm which is really really really helpful erm it's like  the person you gotta screen  s er display th d er size on their d on their device on their phone or tablet erm it gets that and it er and you adjust the code to fit the er display size that's like that that's erm RWD responsive web design it's e called fluid as well there's like fluid erm disp erm er type of programming erm in HTML there's like fluid layout and erm I I I use RWD I use I use media query but erm definitely erm I think like erm knowedge leads to knowledge and erm knowledge builds as well erm I think like everything builds so I I d come from almost nothing so I'm I'm completely self-taught basically apart from like some of the er photo courses erm photography courses and erm basically self-taught I mean like a lot of googling I d er I done er  so that was saying before  about the copy and paste I I do that all the time I copy and paste and make alterations  whatever it is needed  erm er but yeah erm it definitely builds and I think it's fun as well for me anyway there's one person   out there with a camera or something w whatever it is erm erm I I I love it anyway so erm I like being me so erm like interests that I have so erm 
 yeah 
 I I I   I think like erm w what it is erm i it erm you do the same thing over and over again but with some erm like erm differences but but I think basically it is the same thing over and over again erm so if you you get like one chunk of code to work without any errors or something it w it works then why not use it over and over again 
 erm that's that's that's what I do so erm rather than sitting like sitting down at a computer and writing like hand writing ten thousand lines of code or something erm 
 maybe write just like two hundred lines of code and copy and paste it and that that so with with with some brain fade that's the way that's what works for me so 
 yep yep right well there's erm on on for instance on the computer erm I could pick like the save all button on Netbeans if you done like er erm some alterations to the code I click it and then three seconds later I'm not sure if I've clicked it or not erm erm 
 right erm   or if I go down the stairs erm I'm upstairs at the moment if I go down the stairs erm I get to the kitchen and I'm not sure how I walked down the stairs erm that that kind of thing so y erm 
 erm erm it it erm in terms of of the the er techniques I have to use I copy and paste definitely erm so erm I say w like erm I I could work from the on the file for a couple of days basically a week later it's all gone except for like the fundamentals obviously I know how the fundamentals work but the specifics are all gone so I come back to the code erm I try to use like with variable naming erm variable n names that I would remember erm so it's like random object one or something rather than calling it whatever erm so there's like there's like naming conventions and purposes that definitely helps but erm erm so I know like if it's like a four loop for instance or while loop anything like that then obviously I know that erm erm I know what a four loop is and or what a while loop is but the s specifics are in s the the code inside of the four loop or the while loop they couple of days it could be gone like erm what variables I've used erm images I've used whatever it is so erm w but when I say brain fade   it is that is that's what I that's what I mean 
 but I don't think I hope touch wood it's not Alzheimer's or anything but I've had this many many years and that that's what I have so 
 erm but it's not it it it it's not a huge problem but erm it's something so 
 well erm so like erm without copy and paste I'd be absolutely stuck so erm so that it that's the way I get it done is is definitely copy and paste so 
 yep er it it w it like it erm w what it is mostly erm in programming on a website now is like JQuery which is a framework they're called frameworks and erm so the syntax is the same so erm they're on online there's there's like a website called stack overflow and erm there's others as well but there's stack overflow and you name a question it's been asked and it's been answered so that that's like a big repository online 
 stack overflow dot com erm if if you if you name a question if you mention a question and it's been asked it's been answered and that's another huge boon for me it it erm so what I do is erm I I use like a er Nintendo DS 2DS if it if it's like for Python I I start the the search query with Python or if it's for Javascript I start with Javascript and erm then I'll then put in  when  you're trying to search for and you name it it's been asked so 
 that's that's hugely helpful as well I I done a lot of googling with it erm o over the years so erm that's like erm like the main the main website out there is stack overflow which is like an like an error in Java I think stack overflow error so they named it from that and erm s if you are learning coding I'd def h h h hugely recommend their website cos you know you can ask any like er a thousands of questions and they've all been asked all been answered 
 and they code some of the questions like erm they they get like sufficient number of answers and they close the question so you can't post any more responses to it erm 
 well well it could be it could be like something like that that you're like specifically trying to work out how to do so you type it in I say like erm when I first started it was like erm rendering hints in Java so it was probably like Java rendering hints so y erm I used er I used like a Nintendo 2DS and it's really quick erm you don't have to start the computer up you start it up it it's starts up in about ten seconds and you're you're er immediately online with it and erm so y you ah if it's something that you're stuck on you you ask it it's been on it's been asked and answered it's like a huge repository they got like thou tens of thousands of questions I suppose s er it's not it's like erm all kinds of programming languages erm so er if you're on that that's erm that's what I would do if I was you if you're trying to learn coding is to is to  google it I afraid if you're self teaching  it's alright it's what I've done so erm 
 yeah dot com s stack overflow d dot com so that is th er I er I   it's like huge they got like me mill like m m m m m m m m millions of people l use it er so it's like a huge repository for you so there are there's like code ranch but erm I think stack overflow is is like the most important and it's the best one there is so and they they like y y any any programming languages like Python anything they they do so and it's always been asked you if you type in sometimes you got er erm takes ten minutes something you gotta search like several posts to get the information that you want that people have posted 
 but invariably you get what you want so it's definitely stack overflow dot come I def definitely recommend it so if you do   HTML or Javascript just search Javascript and whatever you want to know functions OOP or anything anything you want and you get the results back and then erm almost always like s er there's like a stack overflow in there there's erm something called W3 schools which is o o for Javascript as well they're like they're like a main resource as well erm but it if you   I don't know what kind of programming you're doing but erm if it's for HTML for what's on the internet then it's like a framework that a framework's really helpful as well like JQuery is like the is like the old one it's been around for many many years but there's n nowadays there's like er ReactJS and ViewJS which erm like the er professionals use to like program like er web apps using Javascript 
 what's that 
 erm yeah well erm w what's what is the time now 
 erm quarter to quarter to four ten to four yeah erm like is is it any more any anything else you want to 
 yeah 
 OK right OK 
 well erm like e e I saw him just before Christmas and I think he's leaving his post erm sometime this year 
 erm he said like August this year I think he's leaving so 
 I'm I'm not sure where he's going to but he said did say I probably wouldn't see him again like w er I I see the erm doctor once a year just about 
 part of my treatment so he he did say he might be leaving in August but I'm not sure 
 OK right 
 erm yeah that's OK yeah er b what so when it's in person it's like o on a computer and it's just answering questions 
 OK right 
 yeah it's OK it's OK 
 right 
 OK then 
 right cheers 
 OK speak to you later ",clinical
do you feel like you use language creatively?," can you repeat that 
 yes I do to some extent I I speak every day to fellow residents in the hostel and I talk creatively from time to time and I also write literature which isn't spoken but it is the written word and I'm creative in that sense too an I'm saying that my main form of creative speech is with residents in the hostel where I talk originally from time to time 
 yes I talk with residents in the hostel and I speak originally 
 er I can't think of any examples at the moment but erm I said I can't think of any examples at the moment 
 is it important 
 er I don't think so actually I talk to people anyway whether I'm original or not 
 but if I'm original it can be a boon it can make me feel happy I have a sense of humour a wit 
 yes it's chancely yes unintended 
 it's quite pleasing it gives me a fillip gives me a p boon it is pleasurable I like to talk to people anyway but if I'm creative as well with language that's a boon 
 good 
 erm well as l I said it's unintended if I make the an original speech or if I use my sense of humour that is unintended but I can't think of any examples which would be helpful I er it would be good to think of an example then I I would demonstrate what I'm saying but I can't think of anything at the moment 
 yes I can make a pun yes something like the pointless point 
 yes 
 sorry 
 metaphors I don't know 
 yes I don't know I can't think of anything there 
 yes it can be a pleasant surprise to have a turn of phrase or a point of wit it can be suprising and pleasing creativity is quite pleasing 
 er I write short stories 
 about people going on holiday families going on holiday that sort of thing 
 yes one of my favourite authors is W Sommerset Maugham I love his novel The Moon and Sixpence which is about the great artist Paul Gauguin 
 very good novel that by Maugham very fine novel yes 
 well it's about the stock broker Paul Gauguin who gave up being a stock broker in Paris in at the age of forty and went to live in Haiti where he painted beautiful women and had lots of sex so he broke free from the rat race and went to live in Haiti 
 yeah 
 well it's one of my favourite novels I also like D H Lawrence 
 well you know erm D H Lawrence writes mainly about sexual problems which is interesting 
 erm well humour is important as a way of sh expressing pleasure it's nice to make a joke out of things or say something original which is witty an that can be a boon and very pleasurable 
 yes yes it's important to be original 
 I think it's important to create and if you speak creatively it gives you a vehicle for sharing things with other people that can be pleasurable to you and pleasurable to them it can make you laugh 
 if you if you crack a joke or make a witticism it can make you laugh which is a pleasure 
 ah the y yes I might even make fun of some people in a good natured way erm s I come up with phrases like wit and Wendy which is the wrong way round of saying wet and windy so if I say wit and Wendy I make a joke out of wet and windy 
 quite often I use a word er a phrase like that or a spoonerism 
 well there was a don at Oxford called Professor Spooner who invented the spoonerism and er h he came up with phrases like erotic blacks which is a spoonerism for erratic blocks 
 yes it can be very witty a spoonerism it you  tend to get things muddled in sound of the words  so you turn things upside down or opposite but it's it's quite con satisifying to make er f spoonerism cos it cliques your argument and gives you a point of wit at the same time 
 yes the sound is important yes cos it's sort of musical a f spoonerism it's the wrong way round which is musically you can work out what it means by er th swapping the words round makes spellings different it erm the main pleasure of a spoonerism is the wit of the inversion or the opposition  it is a pleasure to speak as er a spoonerism  
 it varies sometimes they're unintended sometimes they're voluntary 
 it varies a lot 
 sort of random I think 
 er 
 well the spoonerisms are quite common there are other forms of wit like erm a play on words like a pun as you mentioned before 
 yes that would be correct yes that's right yes 
 well I can't remember exactly at what age I started to speak wittily but erm wit is important to me 
 er well it's important to erm make good fun of things or people as a way of getting on with them if you make fun of somebody you can get on with them better than if you don't make fun of them so it's important in that sense and erm wit can make you laugh that's the pleasure of a wit it makes you laugh 
 that's right yes 
 yes yes 
 yes the sound of language is important to me words have their own meaning and spellings and sometimes you can have two words that have different spellings but the same sound like pleasure and pleisure P L E I S U R E it's not quite the correct spelling of the word but you can spell it as P L E A S U R E and P L E I S U R E and if you let the music resonate in the sound of the words it can be humourous and you can get m bril more meanings than one from the sound of each word 
 it can do yes it can affect my judgement in the matter when I'm talking to people and I want to be witty I can think of two words that have similar meanings but different spellings but the same sound like pleasure and pleisure as I mentioned 
 yes they don't always understand my jokes but erm they laugh when they understand which is er the main   object of the exercise 
 yeah 
 yes they have to fathom my meaning from the sound of the word or the words and if they understand me they laugh which is a pleasure to me again 
 yes it is pleasurable to make people understand and communicate and make contact with people and share an idea on a common basis that we both understand that is a pleasure 
 yes like I understand when when somebody understands me it registers in my erm voice and my eyes and we share and communicate together and that's important 
 that's right it's a good way of putting that yes that's very good yes well done yes 
   
 well not necessarily I don't like to be complicated but erm every now and then I make a joke which is difficult to understand I might make a joke like erm what do you call a man with a stick in his leg and the answer is Rodney 
   
 that's the sort of joke I like you know it it's not completely creative on my part but it is a witticism on my part 
 I like jokes like that where you you expect a double entendre 
 n erm I'm not sure erm sometimes if I crack a joke and they don't understand I leave it there and don't press them on the point you know 
 you know if if they understand it is a pleasure to share and it can be a vehicle for pleasure and sharing 
 yes that's right yes 
 yes writing tends to be more sustained and more complicated and more logical than my everyday speech I don't speak at great length but I do write at length which is one of the pleasures of writing I get this sustained run of words in language and expression it's as I say I tend to write at much greater length with much greater complexity than I do speak in everyday life 
 sorry 
 well if you write you have time to think to yourself more and you can break up the writing and the flow into nuggets or bits of expression or bits of creativity th that you can take your time to think about if you're talking to people and you take your time to think about it you have to have a pause or a lull or a s period of silence it tends not to work very well for conversation 
 so the beauty of writing is you can write at length and take your time about it 
 yes it can be more involuntary to write than to speak if you say you have more opportunity to dig in to your pockets and your depths and come up with ideas and er that is more possible in writing than in everyday speech I think writing is more creative than speech 
 yes go ahead yes 
 well all I would say about it is that erm writing is more involved and more erm powerful than spoken the spoken word 
 er but if y if you are a lecturer or a speaker and you prepare long speeches to share and lecture and demonstrate then that's a bit like writing at length in your own domain as a writer but in everyday speech you don't have all that much opportunity to plan a long speech it can be quite difficult to speak at length but it's much easier to write at length 
 er I'd say there's more involuntary interest in writing than in speech but speech can be very witty which is one of the pleasures of speaking 
   well then my main interest in creative language is an exploration of ideas or the imagination or fantasy which communicates a deep interest in the material that you're writing about and by writing you share this opportunity of thinking and writing with other people who read your literature when you publish your books and er although I'm unpublished I do get pleasure from writing on the basis that I can share at depth what I'm thinking and feeling and what I'm writing about as I say if you write you have more opportunity to share in depth than if you speak 
 I like to explore relationships I like to explore sexual relationships I like to explore erm travelling I like to explore going to places visiting places going on holiday going to famous buildings and s sightseeing say my main pleasure is in studying relationships which you can't do so easily in everyday speech 
 erm well I'd say it's about erm the feelings that you have for someone else or the feelings you have as a partnership partly sexual feelings partly love partly ideas partly affection t say the pleasu one of my main pleasures of writing is to study a relationship between two people 
 yes I'd say that's been a lifelong interest not just as a writer but as a speaker in everyday speech I like to get on with people and share people thair share things with people and er develop relationships with people which is important to me 
 that's right yes writing can help you to speak in everyday terms too sort of as a point of research that trades off in speaking and conversation the more you write about relationships making relationships in everyday life and sharing and communicating with other people 
 so writing's important in that sense as a basis for research a bit like a quarry out of which you hew interesting rocks and stones 
 well as I say if y if you write and think about relationships that trades off with relating to other people in everyday life the more you write about relationships the more you think about relationships the more you get on and   communicate with people and try to make relationships and writing can help you to do that 
 yes for many years I've been writing for thirty forty years 
 partly reading other books like erm Somerset Maugham or D H Lawrence inspired me to write my own books 
 er I've written quite a lot of erm short stories and a couple of books and a few short novels so I've written quite a lot but er 
 it varies as an aggregate of words from one year to another some years I'm very active some years I'm very fertile some years I'm not so active it varies considerably it's not a fixed sort of aggregate or a fixed thing it varies 
 that's right yes it er it has it's ow w er has a will of its own and you can follow it and develop it in your own mind with your imagination and  if you can enter into a flight of fancy or a flight of the imagination which is fun to explore  
 yes very good yes 
 yes yes 
 OK well it's been nice talking to you doctor   
 OK 
 well no I don't think so I think we've been quite comprehensive 
 that's good yes 
 OK lovely thank you very much 
 and you 
 and you lovely thank you 
 bye now ",clinical
do you feel like  you do creative things with language?," right erm er I'm er do I   do creative things with language no I don't I I don't think er that er I would say I I'm creative with language n no 
 erm I mean er when I when I was er quite unwell I was er thinking about language er in a very different way erm the way I was thinking wasn't always coherent erm er and it was unusual er but I don't know if I er  I would classifies it  as being creative 
 currently 
 erm I mean the ideas that I was thinking about when I was ill sometimes I do think about it still at the moment erm although I don't take it er er it to be reality all the time er as I those ideas stay ah play at the back of my mind and erm I was reading about er relation fr frame theory I don't know if you've heard of that but erm that was interesting because they erm that they they look at the links between words and erm the meanings in relational frame theory which was very interesting cos erm when I was ill I was looking y a at erm sort of links between words and erm I although it wasn't always co coherent it was erm sort of er it relational frame theory  we kind of reminded me  of er erm the way I was thinking er when I was ill 
 I'm OK I'm OK talking about that 
 erm well er I think I was just trying to underst I didn't I was just trying to understand things I didn't really have a an understanding of erm how how you know the basic concepts in life like you know er I just couldn't understand how maybe relationships work erm the meaning of religion I was thinking about all these themes and erm at I think at the time er I just thought let me look at the English language and just try and break it down and see if if I can find anything in it that erm er you know is that that can confirm er my beliefs in my religion and how I live my life and I was just erm you know not as an expert but just er l trying to break down the words and the lang English language and see er just out of interest cos   I was ill and not much er I wasn't doing much else erm and I was looking at sort of erm sort of er links between words er and erm I think er one of my psychiatrists pointed out that it was more w what does that phrase what er mean to me er rather than what it would mean to everybody else so these are just erm these very erm sort of personal er interpretations that I was making about er language in general so I was looking at sentences and maybe rhyming er in the sentences and just just wondering how many different meanings there are and whether erm they an you could er actually say that they well actually from all those different meanings that you get from the rhyming there's actually er actually only one answer but ah I think actually it's just one answer for you for that person for myself subjectively 
 erm well I was looking at the words and the rhyming and er eh tr er trying to understand sentences and what they meant to me from from the different er sort of erm different words in in a sentence but I was looking at numbers too and wondering how that fitted in as well erm ah ah so yes so so the language and er numbers as well 
 yes I was trying to make sense of everything ah at that time I was very confused and to be honest I I would say that erm I wasn't very mature at the time ah l I've   I mean I've got more life experience now erm and I think ah yes l l like I said I was just trying to make sense of my religion my relationships my place in the world just by trying to look at the language 
 erm I think I'm not so er totally er I I was very very emotional at the time and very rigid in my thinking instead of thinking of er th w what I the way I was thinking of as erm you know exploratory just er way of thinking I was taking it too personally erm I was er linking it to my religion too much er I think now er sometimes if I rhyme something I'll just think oh that's interesting er but I don't sort of take it as er being  you know hundred percent correct way of looking at the world  
 so I'm not as rigid as I u used to be er when I when I was quite ill and thinking like that 
 yeah 
 no I don't say things er er like that anymore I just think things like that sometimes er but I put it into perspective erm now cos because erm I think yes I I I I just find it something that's interesting er if I think of it er something that rhymes and I just think about and think oh that's interesting but erm I don't really take that any further or er think that it's reality or anything 
 I don't think it is the sound so much I think I visualise the words more and erm it it's just the visual erm eh when er when there are when I think about something that rhymes it's more visual than erm auditory 
 yeah 
 so I'll I'll see the sentence and I'll put in the er the rhyming words erm so it's yes more visual 
 erm a couple do but they're a bit personal I'm just trying to think if there's anything that I isn't personal erm 
 er erm yeah it it it's difficult erm on off the top of my head erm 
 yeah 
 erm the the   the two that come to the to er my mind at the moment are a little bit personal but er not always sometimes it's just about generic things erm yeah 
 I don't really think about them anymore erm er it's just something from the past that I er do remember cos it had a lot of meaning for me at the time 
 yeah yeah 
 at the time er like I say I think at the time there was not much else that I was doing and I wasn't active so I think most of the activity was taking place within my mind now I'm I've got a lot to do erm an and er   living more in the real world really doing things er b a lot more rather than just sitting there and just thinking and thinking 
 yeah 
 yes 
 mm yeah 
 yeah 
   I I find it er quite daunting to approach poetry er for example erm I'm not particularly good at interpreting p er p er poetry but er erm er yes er er I I I think I think that's something that erm I w I find difficult to interpet if I read a complex poem I wouldn't really get a hundred percent out of it erm er I don't think yeah it er it's it's it's not my s er well n er it's not a strength erm 
 I do gee erm some poetry er I haven't really been exposed myself to much poetry I think I read er an a poem by T S Ellot Eliot was a strong and striking to me so there are a few poems that I've come across erm er but erm yes I I think er I find it difficult to read poetry and understand it compared to prose and plain language 
 yeah 
 yes I I think erm most poems are very intricate very complex er I think they are and very difficult to understand er for er from my perspective 
 yeah 
 erm er erm so my sister is an English teacher   so er erm 
 er she's more into sort of er using language like that so erm sometimes to communicate er and er I I you know er I I I I   I think I keep up OK with er my siblings when it comes to when they're making jokes about er anything that might involve language it's not been a problem or a difficulty er keeping up erm I'm I mean I really just interact with my family my siblings and erm two or three friends erm and I've not had any problems with er erm with regard to er  they way use language  creatively and I do myself it's not been a big problem at all 
   erm er I don't know I admire creative writing complex writing er poetry and erm but I yeah I think it fits to be honest it's difficult I think a you're right it's probably not that at top of my list of interests 
 yeah 
 erm yes I erm I've always been fascinated by psychiatry as even as a y y er er when I was young and unfortunately I fell ill and I couldn't pursue a medical career but erm thankfully I've er completed my master's in psychiatry from   university as well and erm er yes I got a distinction and it it was it was great I really enjoyed doing the course so I s spend a lot of my time reading erm sort of er   a around psychiatry and erm I erm er er y yes so erm yes and I er I I've gone back to I I like listening to the radio a lot so I listen to a lot of different programs er sort of current affairs programs s er at erm er I haven't sort of er er you know r radio programs on all sorts of stuff subjects that I quite like listening to a variety of their subjects their erm topics on history or art er er literature as well as er psychology and medicine and psychiatry so a lot of broad er I have er I have very broad interests but erm yes so erm 
 most of my so yes most of my time is spent erm sort of er er I suppose just reading a lot 
 yeah 
 erm I think er well l er looking back erm when I h was young I didn't really think about life er I just studied a lot and I did very well then I fell ill at erm and all I did was think about things just er in my head and then I came out of that period and I started er sort of focusing on real life and how everybody else er functions really and started working my way up and did the master's and er now I suppose ah it I have a more balanced er more realistic er view of life and erm don't really think too much about er er how I was when I was ill 
 yeah 
 erm   t er ah   I can't aff er I I'm too I'm erm I can't I don't want to really pay for a TV license at the moment so I'm listening to the radio because I don't need a TV license for those programs   
 yeah 
 erm er at the moment erm I I er w er I fit in the radio er programmes while I'm exercising so erm I I find sometimes I miss bits of it er it's a little bit difficult to focus on er just the words erm er but erm er the good thing is I can sort of er rewind er if I r really er miss a big chunk yeah 
 erm I think er being creative with language can be fun sometimes when we're  talking with w making jokes  and er with my siblings erm er yeah my sister often puts in a sort of creative joke here and there that's fun I think er I think creativity with language can be erm yeah er interesting and fun sometimes 
 erm yes I often erm I think er so that I I think just erm thinking i creatively or laterally is er you know quite er it can er just thinking laterally can give you a new perspective on things sometimes 
 erm difficult to s er say off the top of my head erm   erm 
 erm I think ah I wouldn't mm er I w I wouldn't use sort of for myself I wouldn't be really using creative language too much er in my studies erm but erm with family and friends and during recreation I think it er it's it's it's good er a g good thing to erm use 
 er yes yes I think so 
 erm er no I can't think of anything off the top of my head that erm that I would particularly want to highlight 
 erm er erm I I'm just just wondering erm sort of er the erm the size of the project h er h how how many participants are participating in the project 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yes 
 and would that be sp spread out throughout the UK or 
 yes erm er just er one thing probably on a tangent that I wouldn't cover erm erm I think when I'm sort of writing something up I've learnt that I have to be really really careful because sometimes erm er I er I I I have to work quite hard I don't know if other people have problems but erm when I'm writing er maybe something er up on a er a topic li er psy er sort of a psychiatric topic erm I have to I've learnt to be really careful cos sometimes my ideas can be be a little bit logical illogical erm so I have to work really hard at going looking through it and making sure that it does make sense I don't think th that's something that comes naturally to me I don't know other er if other people have problems with that as well but I work quite hard to er to make my written assignments er t er t erm make er logical er ger sort of erm er are written in a logical sequence 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah yeah well I I just learn like I have to put a lot of attention into that to make sure it's correct and erm I   I don't know how I   managed to get a distinction for my master's but erm er I was looking through some t er material on the difference between descriptive writing and ana analytical writing and evaluative writing and erm er it's it's quite new to me the descriptions er the the material that I was reading about this er these three ways of writing and erm  I think  things are bitting getting a bit clearer  but erm y y yes it's i er I I luckily have a natural erm style of writing that covers or a sort of description analysis an evaluation in I supp I naturally developed some skill in that but to look through and I er really really assess the that piece of work and say which bits are descriptive er and analytical or evaluative I'd I I'm struggling at the moment it's something that I'm working on at the moment so that I can sort of er read something and er sort of erm assess it really critically 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 I think erm yes so that's er sort of that's analysing written w er sort of er criticising critically er if erm looking at a written piece of work but erm I I just er went through er ah a module that was describing s how to erm sort of critically evaluate an image so erm they presented a portrait o of erm a lady who erm assasinated someone er in the French Revolution and it was a picture of er the lady and erm she was having her hair cut before her execution and she was having her in it was a p image and erm er the the the task was to analyse er t the image and erm sort of write up a sh a short little a short essay on erm er erm the on one's perceptions of the portait and that isn't er that is sort of erm sort of er I would say er one of the best examples of something that I would find very difficult to look at an image a picture and then describe it analyse it and evaluate what's going on just by looking at a picture an image erm so the er module er the the erm sort of the er the ah ah er the sort of er the best the the example the description of that the way it should be written was very it was very interesting but it was very very difficult and so I was look I was looking at that er assignment and thinking I would   never be able to do write something like that just to look at a portrait and then describe it and link ideas together about it and then sort of erm link it to erm who painted it and the period in which it was painted and so forth yes I think that's that's probably the sort of thing that I would really really struggle with 
 difficult just I th the ideas they were writing up about it's something that I would really not think of so er I don't think I er an of and erm erm I think it's the linking together of all the themes er that arise from that er portrait I would find it difficult to link it all together erm er in a way that really flows and I think I'd be er I'd find it a little bit difficult to make it erm er l I I struggle with the logical aspects of putting it together as well erm I I l I l er I looked at the model answer and er erm and compared it to my ideas and my ideas were very limited I only came up with a few of the er things that they were t erm they erm included in the model answer ah but erm yes I think to get anywhere near the model answer I'd have to spend a long long   long time thinking about it and trying to write it up so it wouldn't be something that would come naturally for me 
     I'm afraid I didn't spend a er a lot of time sort of er working on my answer erm I think I missed a lot of the details so few things er that came up I mean er er er I knew it was erm the it was about erm the lady er erm from the portrait they came up with ideas like this lady's quite wealthy because of er such and such her expensive dress and so dress and so forth erm she's having her hair cut which is er possibly signifying er some sort of humiliation for women to have their hair cut off erm there's someone painting her picture erm I did notice the painting palette er but I didn't notice a picture flame frame erm then they talked about erm er the ink the quill pen on one side and a sort of a knife on the other side and the implications of that and I wouldn't have picked that up er I didn't pick up the quill or the the knife and the implications of the fact that erm the knife possibly relates to the fact that she's assan assassinated someone so these things I wouldn't normally think like that erm so yeah that er 
 y yes 
 yes 
 interestingly erm just er a line that the way erm the the way they were er th sort of erm thinking was erm  their that actual thinking  in the model answer was er interesting er er y erm it it's erm but er the thing it it reminded me of er how I was thinking when I was ill except that they were er verifying it with facts and historical details whereas when I was er ill I was thinking about things but there was nothing to support any of my thoughts or ideas 
   erm yes so I mean I might have thought of a word and rhymed it and come up with a concept erm but er er and it it would've been interesting but er the way they were looking at the portrait er they had er historical details about the portrait er y know and erm they knew the facts that related to the portrait so the the ideas that they were coming up with er they could substantiate so erm you know er for example the er the palette knife er the the the knife erm so it er it does sound a bit strange er that they're linking it to er the fact that she's killed someone but erm because of the situation as it was it's something that they have supported so they've linked together er linked together an actual fact with an idea that they've come up with er erm so th so th so they for example er will erm they were talking about er erm the fact that she's in a white dress an expensive white dress and the white dress er implicates er purity and erm er it er and erm er th it's it is quite true that er in our society erm sort of er wo white a woman in a white dress er can be linked to someone who is you know quite pure 
 that's right I think the erm mechanism er the way I was I was thinking and er the way they were thinking about the portrait mechanisms were similar but erm mine was a little bit more erratic and there was nothing support nothing in reality that was actually w er supporting it erm so th they although they're making assumptions and they're making creating er creative assumptions er they at the same time have erm sort of a er erm er ah links to er reality that support their erm their s er propositions 
 yeah 
 erm I mean I I I enjoy er well y at the moment with COVID I can't but I did enjoy going to l er erm sort of er erm art galleries and and looking at the paintings it's nice erm n you know th er it's very nice visually to look at er some of these really good erm paintings erm but erm I think it's more relaxation for me something that I I erm just relaxes me so erm music I'm not really into erm sort of er music with lyrics er or erm er music's not I enjoyed it when I was younger but music's not something that's important to me er these days erm erm er ah I think erm sort of a not I think cos because I spend so much of my time reading non language things like erm sort of er paintings watching films or erm er er drama series er that's it's er very much relaxation er so I'll er I always erm sort of chill er in the evenings er watching something and I find that very relaxing yeah 
 that's OK I'm I'm hope I'm   I hope that er what I've said will be helpful to you for your project 
 OK 
 yes I I would really appreciate getting a copy of er the erm study re er results that you s will be distributing to the participants er ah 
 what would be the best way to get that and when do you think it would be available 
 erm er w will it be possible for you to e-mail them to me 
 oh thank you erm tha have you got some paper 
 OK it's er all lower case   so that's   all one word at   
 yes that's right   
 yeah OK 
 ah OK 
 OK thank you OK I look forward to r reading that 
 you too OK OK bye bye 
 oh bye bye ",clinical
do you feel like you do creative things with language?," OK 
 yeah 
 erm I suppose   it depends what you mean erm I tend not to have a creative output for my language so I can't really do writing or art anything like that erm but if I use it creatively in my day to day life I'd probably say no cos er most of my er interactions are quite normal and just kind of basic so there's  not really opportunity to er language in a different way  or there's no benefit to to doing that so therefore I don't really think that I do not in the day t a day to day basis really 
 how would I define it I'd suppose using language in a way that is expressive or er is expressing something erm in a kind of   I don't wanna use the word creative again in a wor in a way that's kind of erm unusual and that perhaps indulges in kind of representing forms rather than in a f kind of functional way 
 I suppose 
 it's difficult there's no opportunity I kind of erm just kind of have kind of functional interactions so it's the inter interactions that I had get involved in in my day to day life aren't really    creative because I'm in quite a constrained environment m er a f a kind of sheltered housing project er t supported housing project sorry and in my kind of day to day care from my weekly d well twice  a weekly from the getting the depot  never is it really kind of creative erm   so I don't really have the opportunity to in to indulge my kind of more creative side I would sup I would say 
 I don't know it re   to be honest with you I kind of think that I'd like to feel more that I I can express myself more freely and that what I do is more interesting to other people but cos it's not and cos it's kind of functional then I don't have the opportunities I suppose the answer is yes I would like to er kind of feel that there was a reason for me to be creative or kind of expressive 
 no 
 language language to me at the moment is just kind of functional driven by function and not really experience erm you know having the room having room for expression or I don't feel that people really wanna hear me so I suppose  what I think of creative  is not indulgent but it er   kind of er  talk create using language  in a kind of more more  I'd a way  that I'd identify more with   so I'd suppose that I don't really have erm the I don't have the outlets available to me to really be able to use language in the way that I want to I suppose 
 I suppose what I'd like to do is feel that my intellect is stimulated by the the need to talk and that there's something about being heard by other people that kind of makes that important or makes that work and erm I suppose when other people don't want to listen to you then well I have no reason to indulge that then it just becomes quite functional and simple erm but I don't feel like I'm in a terrible bind because of it it's just how life is so kind of just get on with the day   try and try and get by and that's kind of living one day at a time and just being normal in that sense so yeah it's it's kind of up in the air it's kind of I mean I don't really I think about it very much but yeah b I don't know how how to say it really   I mean the use of language in my day to day life is just normal and I don't know how  I want it to use my creative abilities  I don't really have er a way of being out of the cycles that I'm in and so I I kind of just let it go by just another kind of thing that doesn't happen or thing that doesn't work in my life 
 mhm 
 mhm 
 yeah 
 yeah yeah yeah well I mean I don't really have many people ask me questions   like erm people aren't always there's no real kind of drive to hear me from people around me so I kind of just get on with the the day and I'm quite isolated I suppose in that sense but I don't really have er have that kind of communication with people the quality of communication 
 and er yeah so that it's driven a lot by kind of the social environment that I'm in and in and by what's demanded of me and I suppose that there's really there's no demand on me to kind of really fulfil any kind of function apart from just kind of basic communication  not really kind of expression  or erm kind of artistry in language it's a much more kind of  designed to explaining kind of the day to day  er running of my life in a s in a small way but language is th er the use of language in my day to day life is very very normal very poor poor poor in the sense of cr of creativity 
 mm 
 mm 
 yeah 
 erm I watch a lot of TV   at the moment erm I read the newspaper erm I go for walks and erm yeah not much really it's quite a a normal er kind of basic existence cos I'm kind of recovering from illness so a lot I lost a lot of the things or outlets that I used to enjoy meeting with friends talking with friends playing pool or   snooker or something or going out for drink even I kind of lost all that in the course of my illness and so   a lot of my life is kind of just TV and newspaper   and erm yeah not really much else at the moment trying to stay off drugs which is important to me and that's about it really   
 yeah I mean I suppose lockdown is kind of the same as it was before   to me I feel like I'm on a bit like on a bit of lockdown anyway because I don't really have that social aspect that I know it's the kind of difficult thing to to go without and I'm kind of getting used to it but I'm not sure if it's me or my illness that makes me kind of want to isolate myself or that I can divide the two but I kind of feel the need to n to be alone and not to communicate with people and I find that stressful so yeah it's it's always been a bit of a problem for me er I've always had that kind of personality  that kind of wants to withdraw and find communication difficult  and erm find it difficult to kind of meet with people so yeah it lockdown for me is it's almost   I do miss sort er seeing my mom because I saw her I see her regularly but other than that it's kind of y I'm kind of used to being alone and used to erm not sharing things with people and kind of just getting on with the basics of the day and kind of getting through that way and yeah I mean it's OK it's OK to to feel that way it's just difficult to deal with not having that kind of social aspect of my life and n  not being able to not want it  I still want it  and but I just have an aversion   to it at the same time it's like being allergic to something good or something it's er it it's not ideal but yeah 
 mm 
 erm ah I don't know it's it's not really I don't know I'm not sure er it's very difficult to put a blanket over anything and say you know like that's how it is because 
 everything can be different but erm I like the idea of it and it doesn't go well or badly cos it happens so you know sometimes things will go well and sometimes they won't but erm it depends it really depends on the nature of the interaction and who who it's with and whether things turn out to be or feel right at the time or or not so it it's it's difficult I mean erm I still need that interaction with people and yeah dealing with it in small er in small amounts should be easier   shouldn't it but and I'm not really I'm just not really geared up for it it's not really something that I was born with so it's always difficult to interact with people and even in small amounts it's s it's hard to really find the place in that for me that really works so yeah it's it's like I said it's like being allergic it's just not something that comes naturally it's just something I've boarded out like I can't draw from very well I'm not a very good artist it's but it's just something that I've boarded out y er it's I dunno I think that's part of like my illness you know 
 no it's fine it's 
 it's ah it's just er I I struggle through and it it's not erm you know I won't I won't go to bed t tonight   worrying about what what I've said or what we've been doing so it should be fine it's just as long as there's good boundaries   and erm yeah I'm not forced into it too much then it's fine but this is just you know I can I can say no and it's just over the phone for one day it's thought through like half an hour so that's fine 
 yeah 
 yeah that the the bigger the worst   definitely the more the more people the more stress erm the harder it is and yeah I mean I I've been kind of withdrawing from those kind of things for most of my life so I'm I'm trying my best to kind of work with that in my life and trying to hopefully deal with something that will help me erm cope better with anxiety but that's difficult that's not really something that is that easy I mean I you see it all the time in erm in the world but anxiety is really hard to shake it's really hard to get over and really hard to 
 get past and I'm trying my best to kind of deal with it but yeah but this feels alright this feels kind of controlled and so it's not so difficult and we er we have a subject to talk about whereas going to a birthday party would be there'd be no kind of rules and that could lead to danger and I find people difficult and if they're drinking as well then they can be er even more difficult so   yeah one on one interaction is probably is what's gone best for me in my life like just having one person to talk to I can cope with that and we can I can make a conversation but I can't deal with kind of an open ended erm interaction with lots of people that would be very difficult   so yeah that er b and there's lots of occasions like birthdays and Christmas that I've missed out on because of that but yeah 
 mhm 
 yeah 
 that's true yeah 
 it's more balanced isn't it one on one it's kind of y er it's like tennis or ah like f   it it there's a kind of elegance to it whereas with a big group of people there's more kind of performance involved which is harder but then I'm not that able to perform on on order very well so 
   
 cool 
 mhm 
 yeah I know the problem is that I don't really feel that I've   erm become ill recently or there's been a particular time that I've got ill I mean I suppose with the schizophrenia with the more kind of florid parts then language is a lot freer and I feel like I have er like more of a rhythm and I feel like I can talk a bit I talk but maybe that I don't really say so much   conversational but yeah I I can I feel more poetic and   er more creative and  now I'm on the depot then I feel  a lot more er like stolid and er it my mouth doesn't work as well and my muscles don't react in the same way and so it there's a kind of romance to feeling florid for want of a better term and erm yeah so er y yeah for me it's the er when I'm ill or what's what's seen as ill then I can be a lot happier   erm but I'm not necessarily so functional and I don't get tied down so much but or tied up so much linguistically but yeah it is one of those because obviously hearing voices and stuff isn't so pleasant and all that part of it can can contribute to the other side of it but erm yeah it's it's difficult but yeah ah I when when you asked the question it I always think I always think that when I'm ill I'm really kind of I'd enjoy my language a l a lot more I enjoy using language more and I enjoy the idea of kind of creating language and using language to be poetic   I'm on the phone   sorry 
 erm yeah and 
 yeah 
 sorry 
 no I think I'd fin I think I'd finished 
 yeah totally yeah I'm open to discussion 
 w ah   
 er it I kind of erm I make make up poetry and erm or I was kind of I'm I'm kind of open to er b being I've read I'm reasonably well read and well aware of kind of poetry and erm or prose and er th theatre and all that kind of thing and I come up with lots of ideas and I kind of do mimicry of kind of forms that I'm familiar with and kind of erm just create poems and and linguistically I'm I was kind of interested in erm in making things up   and in the quality that would bring to my life and yeah now that that's now that I'm not kind of ill   now that's gone really that's disappeared and it's something that I miss and it's something that I find difficult that I have to be kind of I feel a bit like I'm tied up to be well and to to be unwell is more   romantic and more at ea more easy on me but it's very difficult because people don't really want to indulge that part of you or see that it comes with difficult phases difficult things as well but erm strictly to myself I find it easier being a bit iller because the medication is quite   prohibitive er functionally it's kind of w er b stops you f really being expressive and stops you   really being yourself so yeah I miss I miss kind of being creative definitely 
 yeah 
 really 
 really in any situation but I feel like erm there was something to some extent that I was having a dialogue with the voices that I was hearing   and I was kind of making up forms to deal with that form that I was feeling and also I was just kind of feeling that I had that in me I had like a little kind of   feeling inside of me or a voice inside of me that I'd felt that I had access to at the time and so it would be all the time it would be at any kind of time or but mostly not to go up to people and   tell them about it I'd stick to myself and   be in my own room and do it in my own room and an er enjoy that and yeah I mean I was quite linguistically free at the time and yeah I was really enjoying that but it I suppose there wasn't really a a place to keep it  there's wasn't really  a place that it would would stick it was just kind of er a kind of er magic that wasn't r there wasn't really a place for and although I enjoyed it there wasn't really a formal kind of future to it so it kind of died I   suppose looking at that but yeah it was it kind of regreat I'm kind of regretful that it it's something that I've lost it's something that I mourn quite a lot 
 mhm 
 honestly er no   the medication that they put you on for for the illness that I had is   just anathema to that kind of feeling it it's that feeling of kind of lightness and kind of ease and I don't have that any more because  with the depot with my muscles become tight  and my ability to move my mouth even becomes a er it a lot more becomes a lot more difficult and my brain kind of slows down again and it it becomes a lot quieter and it the attempt to to even kind of access that again kind of is really depressing because it doesn't work there's nothing there it's like I wouldn't say it's like someth like something's blacked out a bit of the window and you can't you can't see that way anymore it's just not open anymore and I kind of miss that sh ability to look at the world that way and yeah er oh and it's annoying you know but yeah I don't I just it's not that I don't agree with the medication because I know that a lot of people think that I need it but I just think that the medication isn't ideal the side effects from it are quite severe and although it's kind of helped me kind of calm down a lot I I feel that it's turned something off or blacked something out really mm if I'm honest with you then I don't think it's really compatible with medication and that's one of are the struggles I think with what what the the disease that I have is that I can't really change that I can't really influence that because I've kind of lost all my   credibility through kind of the more er more difficult aspects of being schizophrenic which is kind of hearing voices and erm physically kind of feeling erm kind of er more bubbly kind of feeling rather than by p er b the kind of heaviness that you get from the medication you get a more kind of buzzy feeling which kind of it is not easy to deal with like seven days a week so yeah difficult 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 that would be nice 
 mm 
 cool 
 erm not really I think that's the main kind of feeling  that I'm up with creativity cos  when you ask that question it does chime quite a lot with kind of how I feel like the inability to kind of feel free or to express myself fully is a big part of it's part of my experience you know er and was a big part the ability to kind of be free and talk a lot and feel expressive was a big part of my previous experience before I was on medication the kind of the d I dunno if dichotomy   is the right word the kind of difference of the two aspects and er what that means erm   and how that kind of influences influenced everything else is quite intricate and quite it's nice it's quite interesting so yeah I it means a lot to me but I don't know erm I don't know what to say about it hopefully as the medication decreases and as time goes on then hopefully I'll get better and things things will feel better and certainly er the medication I'm on now is not cos I took Risperdal at first I had Risperdal prescribed at first and that was a lot worse and I'm on erm I'm on a different one now   I can't remember the name and er that one that one's kind of having less side effects for me but ah all of them  are kind of reduce  what I think is called creativity so yeah it it rings a lot of bells definitely 
 mm 
 cool 
 cool 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 not really I think we've got the main overview of of where I am really I mean that we've kind of covered the what I think happened and what I think's really going on with that question could it be me and the rest will be kind of just repeating myself or kind of I don't have a lot more to say about it other than that I suppose you could ask questions that'd trigger off a different direction but yeah that's the main part really 
 brilliant 
 thank you ",clinical
do you feel like you use language creatively?," OK OK 
 you know I  when I came to England at eleven 1 0 2   road        I went to   infant school at the time I was eleven be  tweven  in December because you know was still I was so tiny for my age  I didn't look my eleven year and my dad was my step  they sent me to   school     and   what hap   I passed my eleven plus because you know the kids back home you had to learn I used to go to Miss     school you had to learn cos if you didn't learn you didn't come out of the class  they cut it outta you  you stayed in the class if you didn't pass to go to the next one and they sent me to   school and I did the th I passed my eleven plus and I went to     high school er       called it and I p I went to top one my teacher mm Mrs   but you know me th I come I pass but you sometimes it's not good to shine I went to Oxford you know that man that used to do cracker barrel er ah I think it er cracker barrel I think it was a biscuit the professor I pass everything he said to me   go and get dirt go and get a clipboard and put dirt un on your fingernail cos you know so much you have the boss' job never got hired but I have some lovely children oh it's good grandchildren great grandchildren I'm not saying I'm stupid but sometimes people don't want to hear your IQ they just want to know you're friendly you're homely and you don't s you don't take people for granted everybody's a gem everybody's important because up to the time you can do electron  you can't be two places at once  that is what I learned no man can be two places at  once everybody must be put  you know my son he I have a fifty year old I'm sixty six a fifty year old son born same   hospital by   he said to me one day mum you know every man is born equal  guess what a sperm and a egg we don't need two semen no man  but yeah what we called each other oh professor oh queen king no we're all equal but it's what we do to each other to get up the ladder yes you asked me question I'm in a one bedroom with two of my sons thirty four and thirty seven I haven't moved I don't have no money  every money I get  have you got savings no I win money  I have win premium bonds  but don't give me who gonna give   money  just a bit of blood  go with the talking it'll good it'll burn down the house yes I'm not crying to you but every time I get up I'm so glad I am so glad and all my sons are alive yes that's

 I am laughing do you know   that bit I got off in your ear like a flea in your ear it was so in me that even   I explained it as myself I couldn't explain it as myself I had to explain it from pain that somebody has had y it it makes sense I I told you mm me but it w it was so painful when you're growing up certain times so painful so painful 
 and I didn't end up having kids I don't know I found it I'm sure there's a lamb here I haven't a son he's fifty fifty-one this year and you might like the story of the virgi i w the er w Adam and Eve    and then you me a story  about my son this that they was calling him a different name but he's not stupid   really he turned up   and he's not no fool c er p mm

 yeah yeah 
   and it's not that I didn't feel for her you know when I first spoke to you  you was accusing your voice to talk to me  but because it's so near the    your parents your sister your brother to tell you a care  that I'm telling you that your v your voice change from from the f human your voice to your brain talking to me now it's the you know there's a thing with er when my kids are big we used to say skimpy and the brain with your body is skimpy and your brain you need both of each other to carry I'm erm   my kids used to s which one we gonna do today what we gonna do today skimpy oh we gonna rule the world and then the next day say oh what we gonna do today brain oh we do the same thing we did yesterday   
 yeah skimpy and the   my kids are big now erm   is thirty-five   is thirty-seven they had their own flat but I know if you are young you had your own place everybody moved in there we b not mine in there for everybody wanted they're boys so yeah I have w er   in America and I have erm   is a housing officer and   is a teach is a teacher he has two girls erm   and   but your mum is she's a   with this fool   you always worry about your   that affec life     
 well do I       hang on they have the open turn on the fan 
 they're cooking just a small flat and they're frying   I dunno I think they're cooking corned beef and rice 
  yeah I think about being gently  but like I'm a whinger   did you   anyways I know I do   on there in a minute the phone will ring they will say oh you're selling out black people you're talking to this well at the end of the day they listen to me I have a friend that I borrow money from but I have to pay him back tonight because there it is I used to say to my   come on one day when the white man they aint gonna do shit for us because we always on about the devil devil devil and who I said  to my son who is behind the the bank who is behind soldier  and they say oh it's I said look I know the devil from in   he s he aimed to pour shit on my head because two three o clock in the morning the bin man calling to go and empty the bowl they walking with a papa somebody try and do do on my head   that's a different story tell you how old   is and how wise she is yet they won't make me bring my kids up that way they they say ah she teaching her kids rubbish no  I know from first hand  and you say how do you really look when you sleep I said I look   I tell the truth   we know what it is but you know some part a bit of fear   don't hurt it's when they come big it's when they  excalate  and my eyes open when I had my son in England a boat I in a boat     hospital when I was in there I see some things and know some things what do I say I know one day er where if I walk home to get from A to B by somebody because I was reading a leaflet a Jehovah Witness hand me a leaflet and you know we I go to every church I if   right there I just go there and   sit down and I was reading there and er it says d now don't think I'm on about this general business this bad good or indifferent I it says the devil said to God I don't know if it's true but it said in the book I don't deny you being God I'm not saying you're not God I'm saying you're   damage the people so much that whatever you're gonna do to bring them back and make they don't look normal they say       line up and I did read it by the time I read it I was back in   road I think I told a lady called   married to a guy called     he's a preacher man now but if a she's dead   died of some cancer Leukaemia or something but he's their pulpit preacher but you were say oh you and that I think that is why I said I'm so glad that I've probably reached my limit and can't go no further so that's it that's me there's a lot more but I wouldn't I wouldn't tell you because you're a human being and you don't want to say it's corny you want to like research it for yourself and I will I will try well yeah it's not easy going and being a woman especially if you have a lady to face but no no you know I wasn't even a     a researcher from   and her husband in the sports car and he good   into that I remember you got fun with my friend   I had er like a with w er we call them people that you look up to er her name was   she took me to the     and I became you know one of them ladies out with their baby you know ch you doing business I didn't even know she said yeah   three pound I been running around with those English girls   you know an adventure you do when you're young but when you get older you look back on them days and you think wow  thems are foolish days  and you can't change nothing because people look at you as being that person but you see I had my boys they're very clever my grand my two two granddaughter one grandson and one great great granddaughter didn't do too bad for myself   
 oh they're wonderful it's just ah a won I know I said one I worry about them I do I worry about them I worry about mm one called   and he's he giveaway he's a typ I don't know what er if stars are to go by but he give away his heart if I wasn't there well somebody said to them oh d oh what you gonna do when your mum died when your mum dies they just get on with their life people er a few people that I have close around me  I will said  I said to them  if I die will so be worried about them  they say you'd be surprised I get on   they will they just do what they have to do I'm worried I don't worry how the world is going cos I don't wanna take God job away turn to the devil that he says oh  you have to pay me ever day  don't tell me if my I'll just repeat you the bank of   there's one team there my son the tobacco that is what really they will say oh do you owe when he says do you owe money I will say to you that I was in my days growing up I never borrowed no money I never had no money and then one day I think     which is   when I was young I was working at   or   street and he sells bankrupt people and I didn't even know I had money   to be to be call this working having bankrupt paper but they called me bankrupt and I had to go to so much and I'm not crying to you cos you probably could tell me a thing or two about what you're going through but you don't dwell on it and you not gonna hang yourself or cut yourself but it canes doesn't it it really does and we get through it if only we sit and talk we won't have to have mental illness that we can't erm like work out what happened there these are ghosting it is it a human and we'll we will find out we find out I tell you a joke I was watching this program when you l er some some safari Englishman let off a cracker in the middle of the dark in Africa and they had er what's that erm the night vision lighting and you should see the animals   that made me laugh and so that's it that that's the end of us now innit 
 in the dead of dark night in the jungle they let off like a s a cracker and the and the mm dark it was too dark but they had the is it the night vision light to see and the animals and them was darting and   was   
 that made me laugh   I said what naughty people could do that like a bit of fun 
 er he n no not away they let it off in the middle of the night or the jungle w it's dark with no moonlight and they fired a cracker and the t animals wh and the donkey and the t are just run er there were there's no lion I don't think they eat enough carrot to see in the dark but they were just going boom bumping into each other ah   
 well ah   now they say because when they say country man country man lend me your ear it's nice to talk because you can work it out when you sit down you're not telling a lie and it really does b wer say a lot about the person anyway your beep went off so I'm going to go now 
 I didn't even   I didn't even   the question because it is not so much the question that you can't answer it's so much behind it my friend I said a friend of mine lent us some money because my son he got into trouble with his bus fare he didn't pay the right zone and you know can't pay won't pay wh   they take it away they came here and fined my son one thousand two hundred and sixty some I didn't and I don't have that kind of money so I borrowed it so we have to pay it back and that's how life is but you know I aint complaining because at the end of the phone there's somebody who listens somebody who cares and not everybody there raping and cutting   every day we look at the   empty there busting each other's arse what's a   probably eating each other then and somebody had my food in the cupboard anyway sir bye bye 
 bye bye ",clinical
do you feel like you use language creatively?," do I do creative things with language y er erm mm mm what is that a trick question   erm   
 do I do creative things with lang I mean like i don't erm I mean language is is like what the f the the sound that comes out of your mouth  do I creative things with it  like erm like making music is it er y erm mm what do you mean by that like could you elaborate on that 
 mm 
   I don't think I do er   creative things with language erm can you repeat the question 
 mm   no it's th this is a this is like a trick question language what does that language that  as we know it means like erm English language  like so you're using that language to express yourself 
 mm 
 mm   no I mean I'm not I'm not I'm not a musician so erm I mean I'm sort of a shy person    
 erm yeah er er like a sort of er I dunno what do I wan say erm  I was just thinking of what the question you said  so I was just trying to respond to it erm I don't r I'm not I'm a shy person so I wouldn't be using language to express myself whether it's through music erm I'm creative but erm  I'm more artist creative  so er using language to be creative I'm gonna say no 
 directly so er I mean erm  I'm more of a experimental guy  er it's language er you're living in   so I mean who do you express yourself to you've gotta write a book to be creative someone's gotta purchase it or you know have forums where you can write stuff down and people will show interest in it erm I a actually I am   I mean I like I like to make small written comments that rhyme yes I am actually I I just thought of it I am I actually I am am quite yeah I am very erm yeah  something I   quite do so I am yeah  
 oh OK erm I mean I I I can't pull anything out immediately but erm I usually erm if say in social media stuff like that so erm I'm pulling that out of my brain so if I've done something or if I've put a picture up and you're representing it I like to use like    possibly  or thing that rhyme  to express that as much as the language as much as the picture to sort of be like you said linguistic it's like  you know sort of communication to the picture as much as using language  so er er I dunno what that's called but erm my my experience of the   erm   rhyme songs that I've maybe heard that I could just like copy it down and just like comment about it like maybe quotes around it so that sort of thing so it's just like a title like cos that's how I use it so yeah I'm creative 
 er mhm 
 yeah 
   mm no er it's not many people would understand it erm it's maybe for those people that do understand it most people haven't got the time to think about it so it's more for myself really and for the people that understand it it's like oh yeah I know that but er er I'm not sure if they will know that I mean  who reads a book who rings who reads a  s paragraphs they don't so it's more of a short like a title if you er how else can I represent it so if I you have to be  quick short  and express it in as like as few words as possible so yeah maybe if it rhymes it sounds good it's good to the er you know ear sort of if you read it out loud but erm maybe to create er attract that attention that you're you know searching for really on social media so erm yeah er 
 what else 
 mhm 
 well maybe then it's erm your  you want that you know incite people  you wanna be friends with like people that understand you so anyone that understands it is either the same erm age you know experience you know friends  yeah be we your friends  basically wouldn't it because it's people that you've exp you know you've been growing up together with so if you understand it they should understand it and whatever it's you know so it's er you're you know you're attacking you know that that same age group maybe or even older you know 
 definitely older and s I dunno I dunno I've never really thought of it like that so er but mm thinking about it it's just me you know I mean er   I  I dunno the er specifically it's just erm the way of not right  cos  it's kind of boring to read something for anyway  you've got so many you know so many things to look at and    stood there reading something for ten seconds maybe it's too much maybe you need  something for two three seconds before er scroll up and down  so by the time you've scrolled up you've gotta read that quick enough to  thingy  and then  you may create them to be just mm look at it  and that might be the picture or it might be the picture first or the writing second so erm  it's like you know you gotta snapshot of people's eyes  to filter that information so that's how it is I think I dunno I mean I'm just zooming into it I'm thinking into it now analyse it as much as you're gonna probably do as well 
 well yeah 
 mhm 
 yeah 
 exactly 
   OK 
 mm erm sort of like   you know   we're we're going on to you talking so er can you repeat that question again and then erm you're like I've lost you 
 mm 
 yeah erm   I mean talking   so yeah   
 er erm hi there 
 yeah yeah sorry about that I thought er I mean I'm using my er erm earphones   my earphones so I wasn't sure if it was me but I don't know why that happened but yeah go ahead 
 mhm 
 yeah er yeah I mean erm f I mean photographers I mean er I I've just met a photographer who's not too long ago and erm I I show interest in that because I do take pictures and er mis just aligning just like trying to get a good snapshot of it so erm it's more of a real life picture that I would do er not creative it's like real life I've experienced it and it's like wow like you know I've been able to capture that moment so it's erm probably er a real experience that I've had and er I just like taking pictures of it like a photographer would so erm I show interest in that I don't have er I don't have the equipment to take good pictures erm just like a normal phone a standard phone  but erm like angle you know  maybe not even exposure I'm not really bothered with that but and you can edit that afterwards so erm I just like taking pictures I like taking pictures it's a history as well for me so w when you get bored you just go back through and you know oh this is what I did last year so is it meant to be you know oh same thing last year you know you're doing the same things or you're not doing the same things so er just like to take pictures and just look through it in my spare time it gives me you know  I've got a highly big memory on my phone so it's like a archive  it's like my erm history 
 mm 
 I mean I could yeah I mean I I I've er I've shown interest in a lot of things and erm I tend to I mean saying social media I don't put everything up on social media I'm not one of these guys  I just like to put the best possibly  or what triggers you a moment for me so erm I I could probably mm I've put enough pictures of food to you know have an Instagram page of food for years you know could put it up every day so erm these these are but I I I don't share this I mean I don't I don't share my food every day you know you got people that just like put on makeup and s er show their faces or whatever it is er I'm not that sort of person so I'm kind of more creative I mean  if I've done food I've done one food  and I wouldn't see the reason to repeat that over and over again because it gets kind of boring so er going back to social yeah social media of like wording I y er I think it's important  to you know not be repetitive of the same thing  then it just shows your character erm so I'm a creative person possibly and because you know some of them look at that in years to come and you're scrolling through someone's time you know makeup without makeup or I don't know like you know daily stuff food you know this is daily stuff as well so it may not be makeup  it may just be like food with ketchup without ketchup erm type so on so erm  being creative's like that as well 
  it's explaining me I mean it's explaining me  er this is it so I I suppose social media is one of these things that er is deeper now digital world we're in the digital world so erm although I like to be real so it's real pictures but er it's seen as a digital image by other people and er in a digital world   mm yeah but yeah erm I I'm just yeah  I got nothing else to say with saying yeah  so   go ahead any more questions 
 yeah I mean sorry like it's not deep it's just like you know I don't think it's necessary right now but erm it's just how pe how it really is like I've mentioned real pictures and then we're going to digital it's like wandering someone wanders in their bedroom looking at the ceiling thinking oh this and this is the fat I mean erm software testing so er I have a sort of into into software so I understand the backend of like what creates er transfer of data through satellites etcetera even physical you know   software as well so I have a good insight and I understand it so er it it's a bit freaky to some people maybe because I'm good at maths as well some people don't even know how to you know er er use maths er so I have good insight into life 
 you know I mean because everything th everything merges together linguistics as well it's communication pictures you know this is er this is how people these are professionals in different areas that can now focus on that focus on linguistics and you know I dunno what to say here but erm it's just like one of these things that we're communicating now 
 it is yeah 
 erm er originality erm now no   but erm I mean if I well understand the question er what do you mean by that 
 mhm mhm 
 mhm 
 mm yeah erm yeah being a bit unique I suppose erm I mean I I I'm sure the pictures I've got everyone else has got but then I haven't got one of those pictures er  at the time space in time  do you know what I mean like in the future or now so it it how important is that as well I dunno er how erm for me yes I mean when I take a picture if I've got something unique er it represents me again so but erm yeah 
 er I mean I I t er I mean I don't think it's that important I mean I'm I'm just sort of trying to get into my thoughts my things and I'm sort of drawing out of that now so I mean you  you said there was interesting things yes  but erm it it's how I feel right now it's like whether I wanna open out to those things erm I I felt them   I felt some things that I said I felt them so but erm I don't wanna really talk about like 
 like right now like you know yeah original of course mate when you say it that way 
 yeah original you know maybe that's how it is erm yeah I mean you need to be unique you need it to be you need to be you at the end of the day so that's er that's that's the thing I suppose 
 mm you know 
 mhm 
 mhm no it's 
 mm yeah erm I mean I mean erm being creative I think the the most creative the best creative thing is life to be honest I mean we can be individuals but the best thing that you know capturing a moment in life real you know erm nature possibly you know art you know  being a artist  is one like it's that pers that person individual how he mixes the colours or draws something but er the most creative thing is real life capturing that that's me I think erm as if my personality if you want to make a note of that  so I like to capture that real you know  it's not like made up art you know mixing black and blue and oops I put a bit too much white I don't focus on that too much you know so erm that's what pictures are to me so that's how I like to be creative 
 so you can't go wrong you can't go wrong with real life that's life it's a moment it's no one can dispute it no one can grade it who cares about the grade that you get you know at the end of the day so er you know I did art at school or I passed with like good er good grades you know erm that was me drawing but the real art is life I suppose that's what we really wanna do that's to live happy lives 
 yeah mhm 
 and it gives joy now because th you know lockdown go out you could go out to the park you can't go here there you can't get distracted by what life erm gives you or individuals give you just go into the park and you see nature analyse that then like you know go back home lockdown and do what you gotta do ey if you're miserable then fix it you know you go back to the park go for a little walk have you fixed yourself yet    well go back in and out in a line  until you fix yourself be happy what else can you do what else can the government do I suppose erm I mean I'm not I'm not about j bout I'm not saying the government what the government does is a good thing but er I'm just saying like you know where we have to be our own doctors 
 yeah 
 mhm no it it's become   normal now hasn't it like the it   I've read we're gonna through like the third possible lockdown I mean how did I get the information I think I read it somewhere and  I also haven't got time to read or watch this news now  because it's just the same over and over again I was injured and I had no other thing to do but you know just    around me but now I'm more active with my legs I'm trying to I mean it does hurt but erm  I wanna spend less time on other people's informations  and like and be real again like I said like you know need to like live life in their real form so reading stuff third lockdown hey someone's got a plan for that now what have you done with your time that's more   important because you s gonna be locked in your house again is that the case you know so erm work work work   
 earn that mo er earn the benjamins that's it 
 different times   yeah I don't know like yeah it's hard out there right now there isn't any and the government's like put a halt on that as a   so what we crave for is not there anymore what happened to it you know it's getting swallowed away by somebody I mean it's just not there I don't know live within your means and that's it 
 you know and that's that's the nation 
 mm come on now yeah sorry 
 er I just missed that do I get the time to do that bit sorry 
 oh er y erm mm yeah sometimes I mean it it's gotta be in a particular location it's gotta be it's gotta be right there's no point taking a picture if it's not right so erm sometimes I can but I I'm doing less of it because I'm er  I'm trading it for cash  the perfect location is for me right now is er my creativity is er I'm doing a little project so that is it has be in a particular location and  I've traded it for cash    I've surrendered to the money 
 mm yeah s I mean you probably you probably don't understand that because you don't know what I'm seeing what I'm feeling what I'm looking at but erm just to break it down to you what I mean by that is erm I'm doing something er a little project of mine and a er bit of creative work and er I've been taking pictures of that but then er  I'm not able to take pictures anymore from that  positions position   or location because  there was a start and a end to it so that location I can't pictures with  so I'm not taking pictures anymore because erm I I'm not a  I'm not able to that to that position  I've rented out somewhere   I've rented it out so I can't go to that location 
 so that's what I mean yeah I've rented out a room it's from a  it's a picture from a room window  l er and there's no point taking pictures there from another angle it doesn't mean anything to me so er so then it might mean might be something I share as well so I'm not sure  I have a archive like I said  it maybe I do or maybe I don't but my archive is my folder on my phone 
 it just means no er er the pro it's ongoing but erm having a picture of erm that er I if y if you're talking about being creative like if you know taking pictures I'm not able to take pictures from that location it was it er it was a perfect location for a picture so like I said to you like you know 
 you've gotta get the exposure the lighting there's no point taking a picture facing the sun 
 or with the camera facing the sun and er you know cos y know that wouldn't be a good picture so erm this is like one of those things I'm just trying to explain to you because you thought you understood me but er maybe you're talking about your own experience er yeah you understand do I need to understand you   but erm er we're just communicating here but erm it is just that erm sorry   if I've upset you 
 yeah yeah yeah like like you are 
 yeah I mean I didn't want you to go off in a particular angle cos so erm cos you're trying to analyse me and er erm you know 
 yeah I don't talk about you   
 I don't talk about you 
 er it's a joke but OK 
 er erm no no no it's al I've got things to do we've been on the phone more than twenty minutes s er actually sixteen minutes    
    so yeah I dunno   so erm do I hear back from you  are you gonna phone me more frequent  or er how is it are you analysing this er what's gonna happen 
 mhm 
 mhm 
 alright 
 mhm 
 oh right 
 mm yeah 
 yeah yeah yeah definitely I mean erm to be honest er er  I sort of talking to you  I sort of like you know pondered into my world and er into that sort of you know I dunno that world and I felt something oh interesting you know er we don't really do that and it it's kind of scary as well like oh I felt that something erm it was a different it's a feeling I think so I was like well you know I'm not sure how to erm express that but erm  I felt that maybe if I read your stuff erm I wanna see how it sort of looks  
 you know I w what you see from it but you know I I I felt something just like wondering into my world and into my brain and  like this that and the other and expression  and it it it it it it sort of captured something as a feeling for me as well  as much as catching something feeling is a is a point you know  so reading your stuff we'll see how it  how that feeling relates to your language writing  so erm but anyway but g w yeah I'll I'll give you my e-mail address shall I text you on this line 
 or 
 alright 
 oh yeah 
 mhm mhm 
 sure 
 mm 
 yeah yeah yeah er th er we all do I mean we all do erm like definitely yeah I mean erm yeah send me this stuff and you know if we do talk in the future then erm it'd be er nice you know to see where it goes 
 because we don't know what we're doing with this stuff like it aint like I don't know what I'm doing either   no one knows what they're doing 
   yeah it's er a one of those things that let's see what we're doing let's see what we can do let's like I always think of it as a positive thing let's use this and do good things with it 
 yeah sure aw thanks erm yeah it was good talking to you as well 
 yeah I do as well yeah yeah  I'm mean  erm like itching to get out so er yeah I'm gonna make a coffee and like head out so erm you have a good day as well   
 and I'll send you my e-mail address and   talk in the future I don't see why not like you know   why not take care   
 alright bye bye bye 
 yeah sure thanks thanks a lot bye bye ",clinical
do you feel like you do creative things with language?," OK yeah 
 yeah w so what university are you from 
 mm   yeah 
 yeah yeah er yeah OK OK th yeah that's fine yeah carry on mm 
 erm not really no no 
 erm I I find it quite hard communicating with people really 
 y 
 erm 
 go on go on go on 
 oh oh I got a mental illness that's why I'm a bit mentally ill I've got schizophrenia 
 I've I've got I erm I'd er I I I haven't had the experience to go out and do stuff like if you know what I mean  like chatting people to stuff  like that or quite I like to keep myself to myself really 
 yeah yeah erm 
 how'd you put  quate creativity  in language how do m how'd you put that yourself 
   
 yeah yeah yeah 
 yeah 
 that's a bit   as well yeah erm creativity I I find it  ar   I find that hard hard question altogether really    it's 
  what about my mental health illness  
 oh like sorry I I misunderstood what you said there yeah go on 
 yeah 
 erm yeah I've got an illness but yeah I'll talk about it I don't mind yeah I'll I've been ill since the age of about eighteen and I'm forty-five now but I'm getting better all the time hello 
 yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
 erm yeah at the moment I've been really well at the moment  t tell r truth  I've er I get better er each year each year goes by I get a bit better yeah 
 erm in some ways in some ways yeah yeah in some ways yeah I find it hard to talk about really it's a er one of them ones really 
 but I don't mind talking about it briefly yeah 
 I like  well tell you the truth  I was in art college when I was younger 
 got I like I like yeah I like art er er art drawing and that but I I I like I like my music and that as well I like all the old rave music and that 
 yeah yeah I went art college and I dropped out I was doing really well at the time and I become ill so I had to drop out I had already got a C grade and I was in for a B a B plus I dropped out six weeks erm before the end of the course and that yeah 
 I was quite a creative person when I was younger yeah yeah 
 erm not often now and again I just not really no I wouldn't really do it now I was thinking of going back to art college but erm I decided not to bother in the end yeah 
 what at at the moment er well I I did have a job I had a job up to about f three four years ago I worked for the council seventeen years as a gardener 
 but er I used to do everything I was like grounds maintenance like fifteen pound an hour  but erm they saying now cos of my mental illness they say er  well cos of certain reasons I got sacked yeah 
 like I'm quite creative in the garden and that like doing all the planting out the flowers and stuff like that but it I got sacked   yeah 
 oh it's always nice being outside especially in the summer yeah so I've been out of work for about three and half years now yeah 
 erm  I got my dad's got allotment  I've just come back from there I so I go over there at times help out my dad 
 it's like y it er what it's near it's nice to get out and that I been there earlier that's where I was earlier see cos of my mental illness I don't really go out or do much no more really you know I find it hard 
 yeah er mainly yeah mainly a mainly cos I choose not to yeah I find it a bit difficult going out meeting people and that so I prefer like just stay in and watch TV or listening to the radio yeah I don't do much at all really yeah 
 yeah that's it yeah that's it 
 either go in or out yeah 
 I would yeah I would like to go out at times but I feel like a bit uncomfortable but er s now the lockdown's over I th er w ending I feel a lot better so I probably will go out soon hopefully yeah 
 er yeah yeah yeah 
 I better go fishing yeah 
 I go fishing once the season starts once it's warmed up and that 
 it's nice just to get out and that for a few hours and that yeah I do like it I get out I've got my own flat you see so I get stuck in my mum lives mm my family lives down the road so I got my family to look after me and that but erm yeah I don't do anything creative no more er er y when I was younger I was really good at art very good at art but er I I stopped all that yeah which is a shame really yeah I should've stayed at art college shouldn't I really 
 yeah that's it yeah 
   I can still do yeah I still yeah I can still do it like if like adult education and that but I didn't get round to doing it again yeah I don't really do any anything creative really other than just like not a lot I'd like I find it hard to do anything really yeah 
   talk to you 
 go on 
 I think it's just things getting in the way really 
 yeah yeah it's quite a an odd subject isn't it  creative create  er what you said yeah   create activity   and that yeah but er hopefully in the next couple of years  my life will turn around a bit better than what it's been yeah  yeah 
 so er I'm sorry I haven't been very helpful   with what you're saying 
 I've been alright 
 oh brilliant yeah 
 yeah it's b it's b it's been alright yeah it's been alright 
 erm no not really everything's fine yeah everything's fine yeah 
    really it's it's been alright talking to you 
 yeah yeah 
 yeah it's very nice it's sunny yeah it is very sunny   
 OK 
 OK thank you thank you er for phoning me like hopefully it's been alright 
 erm hopefully it'll go well with your research and that   yeah 
 OK OK I'll leave you for now then OK nice talking to you 
 alright then thank you bye bye ",clinical
do you feel like you do creative things with language?," er sometimes I would think more colourfully than creatively   so maybe that is the same thing I don't know so 
 well OK so I h heard voices for many many years and I find to deal with them mm cos I live on my own but nobody can hear hear me erm and I I swear at them vociferously  but I do find that if we use the same swear words  all the time it doesn't help so I have to be creative in finding new swear words to react to them   so so I think that's what I mean by colourfully rather than creative you know for example turning the air blue for so that's like a colour 
 does that make sense 
 yeah yeah 
 no  I feel for it  I mean to be to be fair I've been involved in so many research projects over the years and with running a hearing voices group that nothing phases me anymore so please do ask questions 
 I just find it cathartic  I think is the word of  it gives me while I'm ex expending a little bit of energy in responding to them I mean sometimes r responding to them in any way it doesn't help get rid of them and so it doesn't always work so   I think where creativity comes in because you have to think of new ways to get rid of them erm you know or to put them on hold I mean I mean one of the things that we just I dunno if this is creative but erm our members of the group say if we're out in in public and the voices are disturbing us to you don't have to say it out loud but say it in your head say come back later at 6PM and I'll give you ten minutes so it it's just erm a kind of a a different way of approaching them I don't know if that could be cu called creative or not what do you think 
 exactly 
 anecdotally I mean yes it it I know a lot of people it helps it's not a   a be all and end all for everyone it's just one of many strategies that you know we use and work for some people and it may not work for others 
 erm I'm not sure whether I completely understand that question I mean I I read a lot and I do find certain films and books helpful with voices for example you know erm to take one film in particular A Beautiful Mind which is er a lovely film about er a true story and quite erm uplifting about someone who you know was clearly very very distressed with voices but he was an in a s extraordinary mathematician 
 Yes John Nash yeah 
 er that's just one of many I may I may have gone off tangent er t  up tangent  I'm sorry maybe I didn't really understand the question 
 mhm 
 yeah   I think erm yes cos I hear I hear a lot of different stories from our members about you know their their their past and erm it is sometimes it's very difficult for them to open up I think we've all got our own way of communicating our stories so and none of our stories are a s you know we haven't got one thing in common but then they're completely different and it's a way of kind of accepting everybody's story and the way they tell it erm I   I said I don't think that's answering your question sorry 
 yeah 
 I'm sorry but during this call I keep incoming   something on the mobile which is distracting me somewhat   
 people that er I've had a friend who's been phoning me during this conversation leaving me bloody 1 2 1 messages so   it's I'm getting a bit distracted by obviously you're not getting it your end but my end it says incoming call and 
 no no no she's gone off it's gone off now so I'm just saying sorry I was distracted a bit 
 mhm 
 what verbally or other forms of creativity 
 erm yes in terms of erm creative outlets that we do like cooking or baking or artists erm   drawing or colouring or whatever creative artistic creative er ways but there's to do with language though is it just erm other forms of creativity 
 well   well one thing that does help we we in our actual group session erm about half the group likes to do some colouring during the group and it helps them not only relax and feel more comfortable but actually it also helps them to open up and erm a lot of our members are very talented in many different ways and they bring their talents to the group so  one of our members makes absolutely delicious cakes she brings in to the group  and again er that helps us to open up and have a social aspect of the group so it's not so formal so I would say our group was very informal erm and creativity erm the other th thing about thing about creativity one of our members erm is ac apart from designing and creating a wonderful website for us years ago erm d  during the pandemic is produced a newsletter  quarterly and he is a and some of our members erm take photos of what they've been doing to be included in the newsletter so 
 erm 
 sorry 
 mm it it works   
 mhm mm 
 I mean one thing that helps me personally is I knit and that's you know it totally helps me to relax in the evenings to knit in front of the television it's it's erm cos especially as I find that for a lot of voice hearers erm concentration can be quite a difficult thing so whether that's concentrating on television or on reading on whatever erm and that's where creativity comes in again if you could have a different outlet kind of concentrate on erm when concentration is an issue erm sometimes it's easier to have a little project that you're good at erm 
 so yeah erm er going back to language er I I think we have different ways of using language especially going back to our group again we're a very very diverse group from many different backgrounds and erm and that comes across in their ways of  expressing themselves so kind of a way you have to  tune in to their particular way of talking erm 
 erm ooh perhaps sometimes a bit disjointed just kind of picking the bones out of what they're saying you have to listen quite carefully 
 yeah 
 difficult to be honest erm but yeah again you have to s fortunately I don't run the group on my own I have a cofacilitator who has worked in mental health for over twenty-five years and she's a much better listener than I am   to be honest no she's great she she gets you know she gets our members to open up and you know she's able to pick up on all their points and   that back at them it's really erm great 
 thank you so 
 yes I think you do yes yeah I think I think there's also I mean it took me a long time to learn is not to pretend to understand them but to say if you don't understand I'm not sure what do you mean   I c you know personally I find that difficult   erm does that make sense it's like I think a lot of people wanna I I'm a people pleaser I I don't like sort of saying to someone I don't understand what they're talking about but then isn't that better to be honest than rather than to nod your head and agree with something you don't know what they're talking about 
 exactly exactly you've put your finger on it that's exactly what I how I found that's the reason why I sometimes pretend to understand but I feel like a fraud in doing so 
 right 
 yes yeah 
 mm 
 yeah I think so yeah I think more so with new members 
 yeah 
 yep yeah 
 I mean to to be honest I love all of our group members they're wonderful human beings and we get on so well together we're very lucky 
 erm sixteen years 
 yes a long time 
 oh gosh   erm well many years ago erm  I was a patient in a old Victorian asylum  called   hospital and I met erm there was a lady   a friend a fellow patient erm and erm when the hospital closed its doors and they did all this care in the community we decided as we were both voice hearers there wouldn't it be good to have a set up a peer support group OK to backtrack a bit I have been involved in the survivor psychiatric survivor movement so that was with   and   which was sort of the late eighties and nineties this particular friend of mine   and I decided to go it was er er we went to specialised hearing voices facilitation training in   erm and two of the trainers were the very famous   who were the founders of the hearing voices movement and then erm we set up a a group and it was very small to begin with and erm in what was then a club h a club house and so that closed down and we had the new venue and then we just grew and grew in size over the years and erm er I should've said erm our new cofacilitator has been with us over three years now and she's fantastic cos my original cofacilitator moved to   so to be with her family so that's that's how we've set it set up the group 
 so 
 well during the pandemic we haven't been running it at all except for over the telephone we can't even do Zoom cos most of our members don't have the erm erm the tech to do it erm 
 so but yes when we're back up and running we'll go back to running once a week two hours er   there's a big social aspect to the group as well I mean er we go on a lot of outings together I mean erm ei either locally or boat trips or seaside trips Christmas meal all sorts bowling you name it we've done it   so erm our members love that because they're quite socially isolated a lot of them 
 thanks   
 w so did you know anything about the hearing voices network b while doing this research or is this all new to you 
 I don't know how this helps you with your   research though   
 right 
 well have I said anything that's helpful to you or has it all been a load of waffle 
 thank you good   I don't want to sort of turn it into a a rant   or something that's not appropriate 
 anyway yeah 
 no no erm thank you anyway   I'm gonna have to go because er it's driving me mad someone keeps trying to get hold of me on the phone but er 
 if we could 
 wind this down 
 you're welcome and good luck with your research 
 I'd be lovely it'd be lovely if you could let me know how you get on 
 shall I give you my e-mail address 
 that'd be that'd be great OK so do you know my e-mail address or shall I give it to you 
 it's   
   
 at   dot com 
 great 
 excellent that'd be great   thank you 
 like I said good luck 
   alright bye   take care 
 bye ",clinical
do you feel like you use language creatively?," do I feel like I use language creatively mm does it matter the context or just in er in general 
 OK OK well having been at university now for oh God almost five years wow almost five years it's th I think that has shaped a lot of how I use language as a whole I mean obviously y you're learning it in school that does shape how you use language but I think having to be so precise and concise with language in an academic sense has meant that mm I don't know if it's creative but I have had to you know make my sort of language very formal very sort of rigid to the point where you know I I will I won't use abbreviations because obviously you get penalised for using stuff like that in academic work and you just can't use them so in terms of my language being creative I would say that's probably er been damaged a little sort of having to write academically only because creative writing as sort of a er I mean that you know it's like stereotypical creative writing so things like you know poetry or what have you aren't really appropriate so I'd say that I may be not as creative in terms of my language as I have been in the past but I would say that my language as a whole is wider and more extensive now because of having to use so much academic verbiage if you will 
 erm I wouldn't necessarily  let's that  th er oop   tongue tied I wouldn't necessarily say that they're at odds but psychology specifically at least for me creative writing doesn't really have a point or like a purpose within it because at least as I understand it creative writing is very sort of fluid can be very informal academic psychological academic writing mm should be more rigid and sort of professional not to say that creative writing isn't professional but erm I would say that especially if you're doing quantitative work with stats and other you know graphs whatever creative writing doesn't really have a point to it because that's not the point of quantitative research I I focus mainly on qualitative research which is the interviews and stuff and erm it does there is an element of creativity in it because it in it involves a lot of interpretation of what people are saying so I guess it I guess if that is kind if that is part of creative writing I guess that it makes qualitative more creative but I would say as a whole psychological academic writing isn't very creative because that's not the point of that form of language I'd say it's more more sort of informative and scientific 
 yeah 
 erm why do I think that is erm well I suppose it's erm w look to any other sort of harder science like biology or chemistry or physics creative writing as I've described it at least isn't really appropriate at all because you're not really it doesn't really matter sort of what the language is so long as you're stating the facts and you're being concise about what you're saying I sup I mean I suppose creative writing can be that but again like from my understanding f sort of  facts and figures and erm statistic whatever  all that sort of stuff doesn't really have a place in the hard sciences so I'd say that for the soft sciences like psychology like I said if it depending on the discipline would depend would sort of influence the sort of writing  so like a bit a like lot what I said  with the qualitative and quantitative differences but erm yeah  
 I have 
 erm in the broader sense I would say that it involves a lot of sort of erm oh what does oh   now I'm thinking about it I don't actually   erm well I would say that it's f sort of like it's I th I don't know if this sort of works as a definition but it's very sort of fluid you sort of you s it's well it's like a story really sort of it you let it l sort of lead you rather than you just putting it down as sort of facts creative writing is uses a lot of erm as far as I'm aware anyway as far as I understand uses a lot of erm informal language erm a lot of sort of nuanced language as well and I don't think that is part of that you know that is part of creative writing which is why it's different from other types of writing like academic because it doesn't necessarily it doesn't matter it doesn't necessarily really matter how you interpret it because it's supposed to be interpreted you know in your own ways whereas academic writing as a contrast or I guess they are contrasted then yeah er academic writing it's not really up for interpretation it mostly it's more sort of this is what this is and there is no interpreting that like this is just what it is  where  it's creative writing you can say things in different ways you can say opposite things but mean the same thing you can have have like metaphors and similes and stuff like that where that is appropriate where in other instances it isn't 
 erm how do I feel erm mm I I don't think I've ever really been a creative writer in any sense of the word er to be honest erm in school at least for me creative writing was something that was em emphasised and looked at a lot but I was never really interested in that I was always more interested in the science sciences erm and like history and stuff so where creative writing isn't really part of that so in in terms of how it's how itâ€™s er f how I feel about my not being not erm creatively writing I wouldn't say it really has hasn't really had an effect because it's never been something I've done a lot of where I've had the ch if I've had the erm the choice to I'd rather write write in a nuanced way that is more academic and factual 
 OK erm 
 ambiguity in terms of oh it in terms of what 
 yeah 
 oh yeah I s I see 
 oh yeah I'd agree that yeah creative writing can be more ambiguous whereas other forms of writing are sort of look a lot at clarity and you know the lack of misinterpretation as it were   I just I was just thinking about sort of like erm   like Shakespearean plays and stuff if they were written academically or in a formal way they would make no sense and they'd be so boring   
 that's ah that's funny 
 it's er it's er b creative writing is a more interesting and fun way to write because you can an you can just do whatever you want with it whereas you know yeah   
 well it's just because it th it you can just do whatever you want with it whereas again I keep going back to it but like with my university work you can't just do whatever you want with the way you write stuff you literally have to follow rules and regulations with how you write your work and which is reflective of how papers and journals and articles want people to write journals and articles which is based on years and years and years of academic research and you know what have you that has been cultivated over a long period of time that ensures that you there is there is no possible way for you to misinterpret what someone is saying whereas because you don't have those constraints with creative writing it can be more fun to write it because you know you can do whatever you like or more so with other forms of writing 
 er yeah I would I would say so only because I found sort of English and er s you know sort of more I don't want to say creative they're sort of the more well I guess so yeah the subjects that used more creative writing I didn't find those as interesting as sort of science and you know more academic stuff I've always been more academically inclined I suppose not that erm those subject you know more creative subjects can't be academic but in terms of how they write stuff I've always been more interested in the academically written subjects 
 erm I don't know really I've I I've always been that sort of way erm I I I've always  be had  erm you know like do you know like those big like paperback books of like erm nature or sort of like erm er ah you know like animals and stuff you know like in blue planet or like do you know what I'm talking about like a big 
 yeah ah yeah yeah but like with more pictures   I've always  I've always it liked those sort of erm books  when I was younger and I still have a load a lot of  those sort of books  now  I have actual funnily enough  been more interested in the more creative writing stuff recentlybut in terms of reading it that is I've  I've always been  interesting  in reading at more creative writing  but when I was younger especially I preferred sort of more academic sort of documentarian style stuff 
 yes 
 oh yeah yeah I'd I'd I would say that I'd be more to the former only because I've been doing academic writing for so long that I don't really I'm I wouldn't say I can't do it but I'm more inclined to write academically than I would creatively   if I were to try and you know write some sort of like story or something now it wouldn't be very good   because it would just be you know it wouldn't be erm as sort of fluid and you know creative in the way that creative writing is because that's not what I'm used to doing 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 erm well I think a major part of it is I think I wouldn't necessarily call it a fear but I don't like I pe I don't like being misinterpreted so academic writing is a very big is you know is obviously like I said is very big on making sure you're as clear and your writing is as clear as possible so it can't be misinterpreted whereas as we know a lot of creative writing especially stuff written years and years ago in new social contexts gets very misinterpreted and very sort of you know can g w be quite damaging if they were written now 
 and so creative writing is very sort of erm dependent on the social context whereas academic writing can be but because it's written in factual ways  you sort of know that reading it  whereas creative writing is less obvious in that way 
 yeah 
 yeah 
   
 well I I'll give you I'll give you five more minutes    
 oh actually ten   I'll give you ten more minutes 
 that's all right   
 yeah 
 yeah 
 I I think writing and language are very much intertwined because you can't really have one without the other 
 yeah 
 well speech is well OK well actually we could start with writing first writing you can only go as far as what is on the page you know if there's er if you know if you have a paragraph in front of you that can be if creative writing now if that can be interpreted in different ways that can only be created in as many ways as it's written you know because writing doesn't necessarily have a context whereas language does you know if you're talking to someone you can you can see how you're supposed to interpret if they're saying something in like a positive way and you know the body language is you know comfort you know like positive then you know that oh well they're saying that you know it it it is like erm if you tell a joke and your body language is positive you know that that's supposed to be funny whereas if someone says something that sounds like a joke but they don't have that sort of positive body language and you're like oh maybe that's an insult instead so I'd say that creative writing is very sort of erm social er has a very big emphasis on context but language regardless of what the language is has an even bigger emphasis on that context especially creative language 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 oh absolutely yeah I mean you can say er since creative writing and language can be interpreted and is supposed to be interpreted in many different ways there are many different ways people can interpret it and they can interpret it in bad ways you know erm I mean creative language like I mean  if someone from me example  or I don't get offended by anything really but if someone were to say er it's sort of like a a sort of a gay joke if I was in on the conversation then I would find it funny whereas someone else could find that offensive so it's very much sort of yeah it is it's very much erm misinterpretation is a very big part of language especially creative language because unless you're cos you know it because of that misinterpretation if that's that's the whole it's like a double-edged sword creative language is creative because you can interpret it in different ways it's like with critique people can critique it more in in many different ways because it's something cr you've created so critique is a natural part of I would say part of that 
 you know obviously we get I know mm I get  create cr er critiqued  all the time for academic wri er ap er academic writing and language but erm that's not necessarily the same thing because if I've if someone's misinterpreted what I've said it's because I've not said the right phrase or sort of you know I've not used the right terminology whereas creative language and writing can be interpreted interpreted in so many different ways that there's basically no one way to interpret it including negative 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 erm I I I think it would depend on what needed to be changed erm I ah ah I y know I erm I would say that is quite a a creative part of academic writing where you can obviously if you need to write stuff in different ways that is that c that is creative but I would say that it's not creative writing it's more of a creative way of writing academic writing if that makes sense   
 because you can write academic writing in different ways that doesn't make it creative writing 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 mhm yeah 
 oh absolutely yeah absolutely like I said with the er like with psychology and quantitative and qualitative differences sort of stats versus sort of re er interviews and stuff I know they're not different genres ah they're er different subgenres of the same discipline so obviously the genre is very dic the genre dictates how you like creatively write or not creatively in more academic circumstances 
 yeah 
 in terms of  creating er creative wr er language and writing done being done creatively  rather than it being creative writing I would say I would do that a lot because I mean people lecturers for example will want you to write a piece of a piece of research in specific ways that then that you can write that in many different ways because you know you pe individuals individuals have different ways of writing stuff doesn't make it creative writing because obviously if it's for a university you know like a psychology sort of piece of research it's all academic that w p er individual inter er interpretation of the sort of parameters of what they want means that you're very unlikely  to say th see the seem same  two papers because people are creative with the way that they write for academic research and oh er the same with language 
 OK 
 yeah 
 right right 
 I would s er I would say what the AI is doing is presenting facts without nuance because the whole point of writing and language to people is that we can interpret things different ways even regardless of if it's sort of erm creative language or academic language what have you we all interpret things different ways it's just it j it it is just the amount of interpretation that there is between the different kinds of language so what I'd say that er that AI is doing is presenting things in an academic way but not in a creative way within that it is literally er y you know you can present s you know like statistics you can present them but if you're literally just presenting statistics without and you know without telling someone what that means then obviously that's not gonna make any sense    
 so it's er yeah like I said it's just statistics 
 yeah 
 no problem thanks  
 OK ",clinical
do you feel like you use language creatively?," erm what do you mean by language 
 so yeah so erm obviously I'm well like I'm I'm highly I'm h I'm a kind of a erm young I'm young twenty-two so I'm very active so I'm very I'm very happy all the time I like I like cheering people up I like I'm always smiling and I I like you know when obviously I s like I used to play football so I'm still kinda like I'm a very energetic person cos I did sport from a young age 
 I was like boxing and I played for   football club so I've kinda yeah so I've kinda been 
 I've kind of been I've kind of been a sport person from m m my teens   and then obviously it were like you know so  went a bit of er mental health  yeah I had a bit of a h r a relapse and then and then now I'm at the best point in me life but I speak very mannered I'm very happy  I always open to talk  I'm you know and I'm just yeah I I'll think I'm good with my lang kinda in ing you know what I mean sort of yeah 
 yeah so I'm a rapper I do m like 
 yeah I'm a rapper yeah 
 yeah course you can yeah yeah yeah 
 yeah of course you can man 
 er well I write music I'm not really a I'm not like er Eminem's more of a like freestyler kinda guy I'm more of a er in terms of I'm not that person but like Tupac in the way the way he comes across and talks about the the poverty that he struggles in the community he talks about about his mum and about how much he loves his mum and he talks about th the wrong in the world the way I talk I talk about pain in mine like my journeys 
 so like  my mine my  music's all about pain and obviously like obviously talking about r real things I don't talk about things that I haven't done 
  just talk about everything's fact everything's real  so with when I first started when I first started doing music I erm obviously I wanted to do it at a young age at like sixteen erm but I didn't wanna release anything because I was so young and I didn't wanna ruin my career before it started so I was building up listening to music getting it like working out how people move seeing how it is erm obviously you know working out how it worked and just bascially learning kind of thing studying kind of thing on music and rap and I've spent a lot of time listening to Tupac I like there's not an interview there's not a there's not a quote there's just not anything I've watched everything 
 you know I've watched everything and and t to be honest I've done it with the whole erm m  moment  out of most of em cos I did I was kind of like room band where obviously erm at the time I wasn't you know I was room ba listening to music playing music and I was just literally up all all day all night and then it come to the point when obviously I come into mental health and I come in before that and had the lessons about fifteen sixteen but erm er when I got to eighteen and I come in here at the start obviously I wasn't that well and m music wasn't in my mind and then when I got to er when I got to low secure it kinda I kinda got that feeling back of m music and I thought like right now I'm nineteen I'm you know it's about time I started writing me music and it was passing the time and I actually you know I've got I'll let you I'll let you listen to one if you want 
 yeah it would be I'll let you w when do you wanna listen to it 
 we'll have to do it after this 
   
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 so when I write obviously like erm what er w w what I do is is er I put like pinpoints like er dots and then what I do is is I put down like I don't just start writing I write down what I'm gonna write down what I'll do like points so I'd say so I'd say dr er erm so I'd put say you think poverty struggle pain erm motivation passion and all these kind of words but I would you know words that I wanna use in the 
 and then what I'll do is is like I'll er er in rap it's like metaphors and similies so like I'd sort of say something like I wanna be free Freddie Mercury you see what I mean so it's like 
 and then I talk about erm obviously I talked a little er what else did I say erm er ah er always had green or grinch in like grinch but I that's talking that's talking about my previous life I'm not talking about now but that's what I'm saying there's a lot of erm   you know what I mean 
 there's a lot of similies and metaphors in there it's like I'm coming at you shot you notorious like Biggie Smalls who's that w metaphors and similies   erm and there's quite a lot of them like er they wanna see me fall but I'm gonna stand tall like statue of liberty you see what I mean 
 so stuff like that's what I say in my own songs you know so it's stuff like that man yeah and actually on my Facebook I've got I've got people that are like on   TV and stuff like that yeah like Father Flows I've got er Alice and Cobe obviously Defsman he's like my inspiration he got killed when he was eighteen from a knife crime 
 erm but like I've he's been my inspiration for the whole of my my journey in music and I actually er speak to his mum and I got a couple of tops off his m off em off his mum yeah but yeah so it's it's a privilege and then I've obviously got all of his people that he used to rap with and they're like they know JK and stuff like that yeah so it's 
 it's part of a big thing so it's I'm just getting my music out there man 
 yeah yeah so it's it's it's it's one of them man but I'm getting there like m m er every time  I'm write  I'm d I'm getting better and better and you can hear the talent like it's not like when you hear someone rap and they just haven't got it 
 I just like I know that I've got it like I know I can do it man so I just gotta keep chasing it man 
 I'm not saying that people haven't got it and they couldn't d d do they'll never do it I'm just saying the poetic point where when they're just starting like when I was there so they need  to like kinda have thinking  
 some times you have to go through things to then be able to write cos you can't write w no thought 
 you have to have a thought you have to have some sort of story to tell 
 and that's you can talk about anything in your life some people talk about you know their family and stuff like that or you know I d I do talk a lot about my mum like or like all the time in my songs cos my mum is a big inspiration in my journey like my whole life for me you know so she is in it together   I wanna I wanna make it for her I wanna wanna show em I'm a better man obviously like the rap scene it is in a sense  there is a lot of people up to no good  but I aint in t I aint in it for that 
 I'm in it just to make my music like I was w I went to   the other week cos I'm doing my maths and English courses erm and sorry f er obviously I do my maths and then I go to w when I went out and I finished a guy c w er was on a bike and he come he stopped me and he went is that   and I went mm I didn't even know him you know I went yeah yeah yeah and he went I like your music man 
 cos I'm from   you know what I mean and 
 that's like my first fan kind of thing you know what I mean 
 and I didn't even know the guy he was like like your music man so 
 it's just ama yeah it's an amazing feeling it's only one person but like people know I do it and it's it's 
 yeah yeah yeah so it's like it's a big thing man just to have er that's er th that's the start of something and then the people that I'm surrounded by on social media that are actually friends with me and then obviously my music as well and it's just like I can see that I'm gonna get up there and I'm only twenty-two so I c a I m I'm at that age you know 
 what I mean 
 yeah so it's er it's a big dream in er like you know it's a big dream for me mu and I'm gonna continue making music yeah getting it done like you know so 
 we'll give it five minutes 
  more five minutes  so anything quickly or 
 yeah 
 so it's metaphors and similies it's it's it's not really a feeling it's more it's more like th that's how rap works in the sense of similies and metaphors are always in rap songs you'll always hear you'll always hear it in a song 
 erm so obviously metaphors and similies some people can write a song without metaphors and similies that's more like you know w more like with most songs you hear you'll hear a metaphor or a similie 
 erm in a sense it just sounds a lot better and it shows more more of your skill at writing music it shows more of the skill in writing music if you can  come up like me going similie and metaphors  like that one that I said er they wanna see me fall but I stand tall like statue of liberty it's it that you know no one's used that before 
 that's my own sort of like like I've got quite a lot of em that I've done erm there's just  quite a lot of thing I can't recap  cos  there's so much songs like that  so many lyrics that I've writ about like what you I'll I'll let you listen to a song when er whenever you're around   
 and er 
 and er it's called mum for life it's weird it yeah so so it's a Nicky Minaj has done mum for life but I did me own kinda mum for life 
 yeah yeah yeah and I got a couple of ones I've got mum for life I've got I've got erm er release pain I've got erm I've got erm I've just got er freestyle but like lemon pepper freestyle you know like you know like the song lemon pepper by Drake 
 no but it's yeah so it's like er all the rappers like using that like meat melon all them are doing it so 
 I kind of I kind of done my own lemon pepper freestyle but that's more than music it's not it's kind of a video kind of thing 
 but yeah so it's it's good man but yeah   
 yeah y yeah she'll want it done really 
 twenty to yeah 
 thanks very much no problem at all man 
 if you come back again and I and I'm on here I'll I'll do I'll c I'll c   I'll do more with you   
 I'm happy to do more with you 
 it's good just to get like speak to somebody about like my music and that cos like you don't really get to talk many people aren't like into rap music or stuff like that so it's good to have a chat with somebody and talk about my music and you know and just to open up about that t because it it's a good feeling when like you know even when somebody said oh is is that you like this and that er yeah man   
 you know what I mean so it's a good feeling man it's a good feeling 
 OK ",clinical
do you feel like you do creative things with language?," yeah I know 
 do I what sorry 
 in what way how do you mean 
 creative language 
 what else d you wanna do 
 no 
 no 
 just the general communication 
 I never I never thought of it normal I suppose innit you know 
 erm I dunno 
 er yeah I suppose so yeah 
 I've 
 er I watch sport I watch films play pool go for a walk 
 sorry 
 long 
 er try and play every day try to 
 er yeah it's fine 
 playing pool 
 er  I can't but I used to go  when we used to go drinking when I was younger pubs and that 
 yeah yeah 
 ss depends on the depends on the individual 
 er don't think don't know 
 er can't think of anything sorry about this 
 yeah it's fine 
 it's OK it's alright 
 yeah it's a good ward 
 what time are we on now cos I'm sure I've got an appointment at ten 
 yeah she should be here any minute then yeah I know 
 not from here d you know 
 of co go for it yeah ",clinical
do you feel like you use language creatively?," I'm intrigued to know what you want to know 
 with language 
 any an this goes be c not really 
 what kind of thing do you mean with language 
 well I have got an interest in writing stories and script writing 
 and I intend to do that when I get me desktop computer brought in 
 yeah I've done it before I'm at a really hard bit before I came into hospital I didn't complete it so I need to complete it get it out there  so really coming in hospital it doesn't make me not do anything I want to do  
 you know I'm not restricted in doing anything 
 yeah 
 well I've done it for well I've been in hospital three years and prison like six months so it's about four years ago er that I started writing to keep me busy was one aspect I mean 
 well what I like to do is erm out of books good books I've read try and make them into erm plays and what s the er plays of some sort 
 cos really I'm not doing the m the majority of the work cos the book gives me the idea you see and I just wrote me me play to it to go with it 
 well it's it's tricky at parts but it's er I just have a skill for it really so this hopsital won't put the dampers on it when I get me computer in and I've been creative doing me art me artwork here I've got some artwork in me room and I won a     award for me artwork in 
 drawing a vase with flowers in it won a   award 
 last year so I don't know how many entrants there are to that but think it includes prisons and that doesn't it and er 
 all them institutions 
 erm since I've been here with erm f the three years since I've been here well now it's slow it's stopped cos they don't provide the the art facility  that they on this ward  
 so I can't do any art now really I could push that table over here and do some art yeah but they  don't have any much in crayons and pencils and paints  
 if I really asked them to they probably would buy me some but I'm not that keen really now 
 yeah I like to do the writing now to keep busy yeah so I'm hoping to go to me father's house where it is in fourteen days and get it from him I'll have to book a visit to visit him 
 but I wouldn't say many people on here are creative they just spend their days just lounging about and watching TV 
 why I would think it is it's just because this ward is actually not the same as any war other wards it doesn't provide the artwork or er art cla art lessons it doesn't provide art lessons erm  for that the other wards  they go to a special building which they can do artwork if they want but we can't go there we're not assigned to go there so  many people on here just erm lounging about really  we can go to inter what we can use the internet at   it's called erm so we can use the internet on Wednesday afternoons but apart from that that's it for this ward 
 they make their own er they make their own food on here as well and 
 and the erm staff make it five o clock so you don't get tram food certain this ward's different from the rest erm I'd say it's th it's not a creative ward really you don't have erm access to the art room and but other er wards do er suppose not many would want to script write like me but er so there's not really much for patients on this ward 
 well I go through the book again and write what I think it  interpretates  and erm my characters are starting to talk to each other and er I just keep going on like that until I finish it 
 I follow the plot closely yeah and er try and write about  in  try and  interpretate  it for different people 
 in the book 
  and how talking to each other  
 it's quite enjoyable really erm er s it's took a long for me it's on me hard drive the the work I do I've done one I've written one already 
 the winter comet I somehow once I've done em I just erm don't erm 
 oh have they give you that 
 to come in with 
 they'll be alright they're always going off but they don't act on it 
 so it's called the winter comet and I've done that and er quite proud of me work that's that's using the book and er writing characters for each and that 
 I did that er before I came here yeah I did yeah so and this new one erm can't remember what it was called   it's ah cos I I somehow don't don't keep em  voiced  in me brain now cos erm cos of where I am I feel erm it was a lost cause really I've not got anywhere w e yet but maybe I'm not putting it out there to t right people yeah 
 no I haven't  I sent it to if they wanted to do something with it  and they all in   sent it to em cos they had er s er what was it called had a special erm commemoration didn't they in the arts 
 yeah erm said t s t er couldn't really get a a city gets it every four years don't they 
 yeah it's called erm the   city of arts or something like that 
 ar 
 it's were in   and our next one's   I think where they just do arts and theatre plays and all sorts of things it's again c to com commemorate the arts 
 yeah it's a different place every four years I think it is  's had it er erm 
 no 
 not for film stage 
 one one thing I ought to do is erm there's a theatre in me old town to me it's it's theatre and I might show them it I might put the show in in book form and hand them out to them 
 yeah I've got a cheap publisher who does it for me I've also wrote one one book about computer studies 
 well I'm good  a database databases  so I wrote one erm exploring Excel database package called Excel 
 yeah 
 yeah it were doing well then when I I stopped it to write another book but the title was erm too long for it so I didn't get to sell any copies so I should've really have kept the first one which were making were selling a few copies so trying to do more was was er well  thin complicated matters  didn't I by adding more more to it like how to do an int how to do a a website and how to write code for the websites and that 
 yeah it is good but it's but the  algorithm  is all wrong it's like how to learn Excel and how to learn websites and all sorts of things it was too long the title so  you're not getting the many people  buying it cos of different ti different things in t title 
 I could yeah that's what I should've done yeah I should've done that yeah 
 it's still very good but ul but erm the title lets it down cos it's not specific I should've broke it into  parcher  volumes 
 another one but it doesn't do well that 
 yeah 
 but I just wanted to 
 it took me about three years 
 to get it right yeah 
 it just felt like cos the book was called it could make it could erm if I could write it in a script in c script form it'd be like y yeah it'd be very good cos the book's interesting so they're not well known books these no I don't buy well known books I g I go for t cheap ones so I thought they've been very good were worthy of a script writing for it 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 well as I said they've they've not been pub published or shown to anyone just yet erm thinking what the best fil er option is I think it's go to the local theatre with them and erm either either publish the book so that they can read it easily or just in just print it off in on normal A4 paper and show em 
 yeah 
 oh right not heard of that one playright's guild is it 
 I'll w 
 I'll look that up I'll write it yeah I'll look that up on the internet sessions 
 yeah 
 oh right 
 I'm not really interested in making money out of it I just want it to erm just go in the right hands who could do sommat wi it 
 are we going off the tracks here 
 is this what we're supposed to be talking about 
 oh right 
 yeah could talk about that erm 
 I'm not creative in music no can't play an instrument just like listening to music now and again yeah you been doing some building 
 no wi your your boots on 
 oh right very good boots 
 right 
 I enjoy it my English has improved enor enormously since I left school I got two Cs in English literature language GCSE but erm I think I can better that now er how do I feel about writing well it keeps me busy and erm I enjoy it  just them things really  
 mm 
 yeah 
 well here we talk to each other and erm but nout not many are er as creative as me as w I wouldn't say I don't see it anyway erm but they're all their mental state's gone now with medication I don't see anyone mentally ill on here once they get them good good medication like olanzapine and clozaril clozapine which is a good drug but I can't take it cos it affects me heart 
 and in America as well it's a good drug for like drugs you have 
 olanzapine's good as well I'm on olanzapine 
 I've not tried it yet but I can't see it affecting me 
 can't see it affecting me see when I get me computer back I'll be able to continue that which I ought to do it'll break me day up very well then two hours a day on that two hours watching TV and all sorts 
 yeah I can yeah 
 hopefully yeah it's a bit erm stagnant at the moment doing art but the only way is to bring that tel er table over here and do some art work got some coloured pencils and pencils but what I've what I find struggle with is finding the theme in me artwork running out of themes 
 by looking in books and er I've done a Sarat painting in me room 
 of some er bathers in the sea very  unknown known  erm artwork from a professional artist called Sarat have you heard of him 
 yeah 
 yeah wi wi with people in river and sat on sat on er marine there and there's a erm a skyline and and that if you if you type Sarat in most famous artworks you should erm find it 
 sommat else I think 
 well it was easy really I just looked in a book and erm copied the painting to erm a big erm cardboard frame you have a big cardboard frame and I just drew it and painted it afterwards 
 well it was just copying really and painting it afterwards 
 w w well I didn't find it difficult I just enlarged it a bit but 
 so I won a prize for f er for artwork I didn't think much of it but er when I look at it now when I look at it again I think oh yeah it's s n not so bad that so erm I won a award 
   award for art first time entrant 
 yeah there's one this year I've I've I've entered  a type of frogs  in this year erm but now the process is slowing down because there's not this is not a f facility to erm do art in this on this ward so I don't know what to do 
   I don't think I'll win with that one nah I j if I win sommat they'll just send it through post to me 
 yeah just send the certificates through the post so yeah it's a very complex erm study you're doing isn't it 
 alright yeah 
 well have I answered your questions 
 well 
 I don't think we've talked about it haven't we 
 oh right ",clinical
do you feel like you do creative things with language?," well I'm dyslexic so in text and stuff like that it's gotta be simple but I don't kn I suppose sort of what you'd call it is it do you have questions or is it creatively 
 yeah go on yeah whether itâ€™s true or not  use to always copy off the person next to me  couldn't be writing a story or anything like that I suppose I used to just be repeating me words  what I used to write and think of something else  I don't think I do no 
 I get by but it's gets quite challenging sometimes when people ask me to read stuff and stuff like that I'd like to get more creative really I suppose I try I have I have tried but I don't think it comes out on paper what I'm feeling I  if you was to speak about it I suppose I can be creative then  but to get it down on paper and speak creatively writing it I suppose I couldn't do it but if you've spoke to me about it I probably could get creative doing sommat 
 I'm  tobably  useless at art it's like five year old drawing a picture and er m b in language er I just keep it simple 
 I don't even know if I like bust my nose or I w nine or ten  I was having little bit of problems  before that but after that it was totally nursery stuff you know what I mean 
 yeah yeah yeah yeah 
 communicate alright and stuff like that  but when other I think  if it if it something's put to me and it's quite long I'll start doodling and doing something else and er I'll avoid it 
 er you know if it's in a group then you know I mean and you have to do sommat I suppose I'll copy off what the person next to me said but change ev a lot of it to suit me y 
 if you get what I mean that's me own personal thing I'm not informed any w el what anybody else does it w m or I get anyway you know I used to be upset a lot when I was a kid cos I couldn't do me work and it it puts me on the spot a bit but er yeah that was it let go of her hair upset when I can't do things and stuff like that  poom  when it comes out I don't know but I get by 
 fairly normal behaviour and stuff like that 
 I can speak I can speak I can speak to you alright but it when it comes out in writing it's fucking horrible for me it doesn't compute up here I don't know why 
 I think it I think it's messing around too much cos I was I was a kid when er when we first started reading well I can remember it now I was a kid me first word y ah ee ee we given a book to read I'd a I'd read the opposite word but I meant the word in the book I kept on doing that and she thought I was totally w were useless and I was just having her on then I think it just stuck with me that I was totally useless and I couldn't do it can't like think cos I wrecked my reading after it as well cos my friend as well kept on doing that there was one day I come to my reading and I just I couldn't follow any of it 
 of the meaning for the words in the book like 
 if you'd it was because and s  it's shouldn't or sommat  I was like coming through the words one by one I was trying to be cocky basically 
 but er it backfired on me I think er we y it started like people thought I was having a nervous meltdown or something like that and I wasn't I was just  gaggling  along 
 that's what I I found it quite funny but obviously it wasn't quite funny to be quite honest totally hon er but it w I was feeling stupid cos I remember like remember doing that when I was a kid if that's got anything to do with your question 
 er I dunno I was giggling and er having a laugh having a laugh at me my own expense but it's backfired on me now oh ho ho huh 
 er I dunno like I'm not very good at reading or spelling and stuff like that but I I'd I've heard cockney rhyming slang in me head they'll say things like we're going to trout you coming out or saying stuff like that if that's got anything to do with it but 
 most er they'll try and get me to do cockney rhyming slang but I don't think people take no notice I think they think you're stupid for trying to be funny 
 I know yeah but in here yeah in here 
 they just pass it off they pass you off as being strange 
 I dunno why I find it funny I just 
 feel that these they repeat what you say and well what's that supposed to mean and then you give them the meaning of it and they go ah 
   I don't think they quite follow me me slang 
 I probably change  it's like slang for suit yourself  
 to what like sounds like well I make up words basically 
 make up words but rhyming my words has no effect er it it for me cockney rhyming slang it's like mine was what it was 
 for every now and again just if it's quiet you know we're all bored we're not doing anything I'll start doing me thing it's a way of f to annoy people basically 
   
 yeah yeah 
 I can't take em and I can't follow la the words but pick up on small b t like erm chorus but when it comes with the actual song what was on each of us I can't follow it at all or the catchy ones they give me the couple of words is they'll say the couple of words and stuff like that but when it comes in for a meaning or something what have you wouldn't I can't m even remember it 
 oh yeah no you you been alright for a while 
 it's just gonna be with all my stuff innit bit random 
 well w as you say you asked me a question what do you mean what's your meaning of language eh I don't know I suppose that's the meaning's either of language or or another point I'm trying to tell you about 
 er I get a bit stuck for words meeting people being around people  what and not  so well and what have you you get you know on eggshells around you you really can't you don't know what to say that's what I was a say as er sort of say anything sometimes but other times in a way it's so hard to learn I have a half way if you know what I mean to no I'm not saying we're close I think they're trying to get rid of me basically because I'm on my way out now out of hospital er yeah so they're quite funny I'm quite funny I go up to them but I don't think they really get my kind of language if you get what I mean my you know w I mean my they can't but it just isn't caught what you chatting about like you know the shit that I chat 
 that's what I would say I mean and then some of them 
 er I dunno I'll erm some of it's got to do with money and stuff like that because I know there are a couple lads here they're only on 135 pound a fortnight and I'm on like 300 odd so I buy em drinks and that from the shop and I go you know a quid for that a quid for that they're all getting really span out and I'm only joking I don't want it back but l they'll then they say I won't come out with you again you start charging me stuff like that 
 I'm not trying to buy people's friendship by buying them a drink but the literally you can wake up in the morning we've got nothing else to do apart from go to the shop and get a dr an energy drink 
 but when I've when I've got their it's more out of mine they do they do give it back in their own way you know what I mean might get a little bit more off me but they make their w they make their effort when they get their own money and stuff like that I have to go and buy clothes and what have you I'll lend them money and they get always give me it back 
 just when I'm joke a lot of times we're all joking yeah I don't think I've had to use conversation really there's nothing serious about being here it's just like we're all held here you say I get   the cheese and stuff like that but you know w I mean so there's a community crowd some of us are unwell some of us they always said to me that I've heard voices but I I deny it told it was fact er I've never heard that I've never heard voices in me life I have thoughts you know like anybody else but it's not a crime to have a thought some of them might be strange but they're not a voice and  they's always t took no notice  take take no notice of what I'm doing but I suppose everybody has peculiar thoughts every now and again I can only put that down sometimes to an individual or somebody that doesn't like me strange thoughts 
 er I know one lad who went and got out of hospital the first time he has ADHD and he's th a bit wild as in he's always making fun of me and stuff like that and I'll d er and er not being moving for a bit I'll have a strange thought but it'll only be  so it he making fun of me  or saying that's what I was going to do or something that he was having a laugh with his with the rest of his mates about if that answers your question 
 yeah yeah 
 yeah yeah yeah 
 well alright fair enough as long as you find it quite normal 
 I don't know I think it's just sh sh just er what were you talking about what what did you say er not humour but I just peck just pecking at somebody's head 
 and that's all a peck they peck at my head so I peck him back it's my chance 
 get me revenge what comes around goes around innit 
 oh yeah I know 
 yeah I know what you mean yeah 
 not very funny you're right 
 er well I do a lot of fishing and stuff like that 
  I suppose it's quite a long with  then there's the small  term  talk about like you might get a run that's to catch a fish you gotta and there's like you call rod reels set up stuff like that 
 p your bivvy your chair like there's loads of different other things like th they even naming the fish the fish have names and there's there's loads of different companies with different products and stuff like that and I don't think you really hear about that you kn and I don't mean you yourself as a person but a lot of us the small term for some of the products and brands what they're all were and some of the names of your equipment if you're a tackle tart and stuff like that 
 a tackle tart a tackle tart's when you want to buy the most  expensivest  gear there is 
 and you got to own the most expensive brands and you're not allowed to go out up on that I've got a little bit of tackle tart but I'm not a full tackle tart I've got a bit it's expensive I've haven't got a lot of money well I had the money kind of I had the money for alright stuff but it's all old now three or four year f five years old six years old so look through er arena 
 it can do yeah and and er some of the shops what you get it from they'll come and go a lot of it's er a lot of the old businesses have gone kind of 
 you know what I mean they're all gone tits up and somebody else will open them and they'll have little bits but not what I wanna look f ing old ones or the old school stuff's probably more better than the bought what the new stuff they've got out now but I suppose you gotta trawl online for it haven't you you know what I mean and some of the st some of it you know I mean some of it some of my fishing stuff that I've got s little bits of it  that'll get to supposed to sell it and snap it on  I've got little bits but I don't know if you don't really see much of the old stuff have we I it goes too quick but it's not a language where you'd use in everyday life you know w I mean some of the er terms you give off for fishing you know what I mean so I thought if people say is it on the dark side but it's dark on the night you fish with the night you spend the s w y you spend hours there like y I m and and I've fished I've fished for a week once not getting in a shower not getting clothes not eating much not got any tea probably didn't catch anything there   this is when I was a lot younger 
 yeah out fishing yeah 
 I think somebody was with me for er first few days but they buggered off but I stayed 
 I'll just go and get the phone 
 oh I made arrangements but never mind cancel it all 
 no I've took the call then 
 a lot of slang anyway 
 yeah 
 I think mo most people in here they just think you go for a float you catch fish with all the small ones and I go for like big ones big carpies and they they always say I catch more fish than they do but there's stuff like that when you have a little catch up on the thing 
 probably haven't thought about it how do you mean they wouldn't some of them can't well it some people they can't really cast out and stuff like that I think they need s to teach em a bit better bet a better teacher than me anyway but I just show them the basics of what to do if they get er the hang of it or not I don't know like a lot of em might catch a fish over their odds er last Saturday we went and it were the biggest one all caught all day   
 how to wind em in yeah 
 I weren't too bothered cos it was  it about thirty forty pound  but for his first fish 
 and I've y know I was only catching nine ten pounders he was he was chuffed to bits with it you know what I mean 
 he was happy 
 he was happy he was saying like like what is it let me reel reel one in I want to reel one in y you're supposed to say can I wind it in and he's going can I wheel it in can I wheel it in 
 yeah 
 he wants to start fishing but er I don't think he's gonna learn nout and that er to tie rings up and what have you I think er that'll be er and to show how he doesn't know how to cast out and stuff like that so 
 I think that'll be er plus where to fish when you get there 
 I've found out two spots one by the island and one by where the shallows meet the deeper bit 
 fish t half way towards the shallows from the deeper bit you catch it's like you catch a lot of fish there and there's an island they have quite a few little islands as well 
 catch as well yeah 
 I asked the ward manager if we could go fishing all night but because of some of the sections that people are on you know 41s I'm just I'm just on a straight simple section and er too much paperwork for em to do plus they got to apply to the Home Office and what have you it's too much hassle for them to do it so he said no 
 I know y for me own pl for the next pl er I'm going a place called     in   they've s just shown me around a couple of er lakes in there where I can go fishing and that so they look alright yeah yeah 
 go there for a few hours and well I think one spot's not night fishing and the other one's night fishing but it's all weed like plants that grow in the water weed 
 not weed weed not weed full weed like weed beds in the summer when you fish in it if you catch a fish it'll probably go in the weed bed anyway so I don't think it w er I don't think it erm could when the cold winter comes along it'll kill it anyways so 
 plus you get some bigger decent ones in the lie low like a horseshoe you know create bumps 
 horseshoe word   
 another sign of  create    
   I find that's where some of the stupidity comes from not er like using everyday language you know what I mean so many terms for stuff like going through fishing which I grew up with a lot of older people what went fishing and you didn't go down to the bottom on the first fishing first fishing set and what have you I started fishing properly you catch they catch two fish and what m what they say is oh nice catch nice bit of fish so erm got me a fan basically but I have me own techniques and rigs and what have you 
 well I think mo mo I think most people that go fishing and go carp fishing they stay overnight they use it as somewhere to take  out  drugs or to drink 
 you know where and that I think you know they got caught em  up in the more of one more pint  they've started to drink then it turns into this all night bar where and then they're pissed going round all the time and then I I I suppose I'm against both now and  I'm against the take drugs  whilst I'm fishing and I'm against the drinking while I'm fishing oh but you see what the water's got more for the habitat and the wildlife and the surroundings and what leads where like a       as well 
 should have had to do with conservation or something like that   
 I dunno really 
 mm 
 yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah there's always fishing you know they bang the coat on us I'm by the water's edge seeing you know when either sun it's rain or it's blowing a gale that's what it's do y know I mean you're out in all elements 
 er yeah nicer if it's there's somebody there you can sit down and you can share getting fried and it's not as nice in the winter always peeing down blowing a gale 
 well I go carp fishing in the summer and pike fishing in the winter pike erm they got loads of teeth they f they tr jump out the water i think they can do round round here they grow up to like thirty forty pound and to catch a thirty five pound fish you know what I mean bit of an achievement really getting it in 
 I went up to twenty odd pound but that's more that's really an achievement for where I was 
 erm 
 well er what it is you'll strike you pick the rod up y know it on you got a bait running on the back of your reel you know bobbing I just use pegs and my peg goes up cos it's a light indicator or you have a bobbing something you clip on your line 
 when that goes up and you get it good take slack and it goes out you gotta fish you gotta wind you strike then it might take the line it might shoot off home or it might come straight at you basically you you've got to give it line or then winding the slack line if you get what I mean it might come at you you w you wind you wind it to get it into your net in the end t you it w either come at you or go away and it's gotta thrash around and it'll thrash around in front of you 
 and it might take a lot of the line but you treat it back on the rail they're it you know it it but they get tired after a bit and er when they're tired they stick their head up then they'll just wallow over your net 
  could take five then minutes  could take twenty or thirty minutes depending on the size of the fish 
 well the er twenty minutes for a thirty or forty pound fish 
 but it depends if you're on light gear or on heavy gear because you know on heavy you got more chance of holding your cow up on lighter gear it's more using the line I think it goes on for longer   
 yeah y er your arms get quite well hard you get toned in the arms 
 I suppose you could take girl go on take go on a fishing er holiday or something like that 
 it's not too bad especially if you go if you get somebody that knows what they're doing and they're camping out you get some camping out but make sure it's a nice day 
 cos if it pee it down it gets all muddy and er it's not too great carrying all your stuff home or to the car or what have you things soaking in the car you've gotta come all over 
 yeah yeah yeah yeah 
 well oh yeah 
 I am kind of like er pushed for time at the moment yeah 
 alright then ",clinical
do you feel like you use language creatively?," erm I don't know it was erm annoying 
 yeah 
 erm yeah because I I couldn't I couldn't see a link at all in any of them not not once er erm like er a lot of it I cos I think some of them repeated 
 but I I the mm when they were repeating  I couldn't remember what my response to them before  and I guess it was all guesswork all the way through I don't know whether that had changed 
 mm yeah 
 mm 
 oh yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah erm like I guess I didn't really know what to what to think 
 yeah 
 oh right 
 t yeah not that 
 because erm er especially because when they were repeating I noticed some of them repeating erm but I couldn't it's not as though  I could think remember why  I chose that so I'll choose that again 
 because it was so f fast and the q so the the questions were so different 
 it's not like I could remember in my mind so oh I've just seen this before I'll click the same one as I saw before 
 yeah 
 that's what I felt yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah I think I was thinking that some people might not know all these words like the word aromatic 
 is quite a singular word I'm not sure I like what if you didn't know what the word meant then the experiment would be would be void wouldn't it but if you don't know what you're ch what you're you know 
 yeah exactly 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 and I think because of y you're not allowed to ask questions so I couldn't ask say couldn't say to you please could you tell me what aromatic means 
 maybe that would be I don't know 
 maybe 
 yeah 
 yeah they're strange words like boomerang you know what I mean you don't use that in the day to day do you 
 yeah 
 erm I don't know erm just erm that there's ninety questions and er er I guess gotta go go go 
 yeah 
 because it because because I didn't really couldn't see a connection as to I tried to move on quick but s to see if I could find a connection in other questions so I thought oh I don't know that one maybe I'll know the next one 
 and that sort of gives like going through the the questions 
 erm 
  yeah erm want to know about  how it links with schizophrenia 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 right 
 ah I don't know 
 but you can't mess it up I feel like I might have messed your experiment up 
   OK 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 erm I guess it's s m er I could think I I guess I responded better to the concrete nouns 
 like boomerang or you know er yeah and then the sort of ones like aromatic it's not as concrete it's it's not as easy I guess 
 because like boomerang you see a boomerang and that's it but with the word aromatic I couldn't really visualise it 
 yeah so erm so when I saw the word boomerang it instantly in my head I saw like a wooden like the actual pic like you know er but aromatic is more abstract I can't really not very tangible 
 it's it's like out there 
 yeah I saw a boomerang in my head in my mind I could it I could when I read the word I could see the word boomerang I could see the p picture of a boomerang as though I'd just seen 
 in everyday language 
 erm yeah I guess erm like erm it it takes my mind less time to think of like a concrete noun than than some like abstract word 
 y yeah 
 I don't know what you mean sorry 
 erm 
 erm I guess it comes from my mind so so if I'm talking about something then I sort of have it in my mind before I say it 
 like if we're talking about like I don't know animals you know I'd picture I'd I know what an animal is but if you talked to me and said the word like I'm having difficulty or something  it's not as like can't really associate  anything with it in 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah yeah it it's more difficult yeah 
 how would you do it without writing the word salty you'd have to like 
 very creative and very ingeni inventive wouldn't you 
 you'd have to sort of like like cheat like by giving too much information or you'd have to like literally draw a salt mill 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 erm I guess erm cheat would mean like skip or skipping over something erm like j just like I said before erm when when you were if you're talking to somebody and you're teas you have to sort of ah like for me I have to sort of have it in my mind before I say it 
 like you need to know what you're talking about you can't like some people can talk like say er you talk without thinking but you have to have some sort of notion of what you're going to say before you say it I guess if you're cheating then like erm like I said with the drawing a picture of the salt mill it's harder to like conceptualise it like not salt but like the word salty 
 that kind of 
 yeah so what like with mm for me then it's concrete nouns are easier to to work out and get get across and other er like 
 yeah 
 erm it's more difficult than having like something concrete and visual it's not to say I can't use adjectives I'm not trying to say 
 or other words but I th I guess it's just something that could it's  more of a instant thing  
 yeah 
 exactly yeah not that I realise it when I'm t talking but analysing it yeah I guess I would 
 erm no I don't think so ",clinical
how was the experiment?,"   that's a very open question er it's good erm I'm not sure I get it   as a as a reflection going through I was erm yeah I was trying to look at the link between the names and er yeah when you first start going through it it doesn't doesn't feel natural for most of them that that's not a link but then I found as I was going through I created links in my mind so er you know I decided this particular word was associated with this word and and I just linked those and then whenever I saw them I was basically matching them based on that but I found it was quite difficult to do that consistently cos obviously it changes the the the two words so I would I would then find it transformed in my mind as I went through so what at what at one point I had as a link then something else would kind of take over that link so yeah I don't know I'd it'd be interest   it'd be interesting to at some point reflect and see how consistently we're matching things or if it is just a complete scatter gun cos they're er the the links felt quite tenuous that I created 
 but yeah 
 er g er it's more like the direct link between the two felt tenuous but then I I grouped certain things together so I found er certain adjectives matched different groups of words and other adjectives I er linked with other groups and then like I found my brain was working and matching on on those two so like adjectives that you would normally associate with say inanimate objects first adjectives you would  accept associate  with more descriptive words I found my brain was kind of trying to create links between them so yeah it's it's interesting kind of listening to your brain at work and it trying to create it it trying to work out what the connections are and sort of I don't know probing as you go through the study between ah maybe these things are linked and then  as you kind of work it through  sometimes those links become more concrete and then sometimes they fall apart so erm yeah as an example I decided I decided deaf was really closely linked with a boomerang and that was just really clear to me so every time that came up I just linked the two of them w which in hindsight is nonsensical but somehow my brain decided that those two things were completely linked   out this selection yeah 
 yeah 
 er yeah I think th it depends on depends on how concrete I'd got it in my mind so I think in the sections I was really consistent you know you keep getting the same words coming up erm I would typically focus on one of the words which for me was typically like the second word erm you know if I could kind of create a link between them together then I'd consider them as a pair but quite often cos they're not linked I found I was focusing on the second one erm it's probably quite yeah and then so then if it was quite repetitive then I could go through quite quickly if I had established links in my mind erm whereas then sometimes if you'd come up again you'd s er it's almost like my brain would recognise when I hadn't followed the pattern so I'd kind of followed a pattern on er this word goes with this one and I was clicking and then at a certain point your brain my brain would be like well hang on a minute you just said this word goes with this one but  you've been mm pairing it with this one for the last four times  so it's almost like it was like hang on a minute we need to re-evaluate which of these which of these go together erm 
 which would then you know create a bit of a conundrum about which one you go for   
 no not not a lot of the time and the answers that I did feel right w were mainly I don't know create er there was some  there was some that linked quite well  like er sh trying to think of examples now so like salty opinion er or like a a sour opinion so there were certain ones that I could definitely link and think OK I w I would I would describe something as that one w er but there was but there was a lot of them w where I couldn't really create a link and I just sort of made I a made a link in my mind so that I could match it basically 
 yeah 
 er as in matching those kind of words to opinion do you mean or 
 I definitely noticed at one point I was assigning a lot of words like that to say opinion attitude and then it suddenly dawned on me that I was putting quite a lot of negative words with er I'm trying to remember the link now but there's like opinion attitude and there was another which was kind of about personal expression and I was putting a lot of the er like silent quiet with edge er that was more because when I was picturing edge in my mind I was picturing sitting on a quiet edge somewhere like looking out over a valley so that's kind of the picture my mind created with edge so all of the silent quiet still that was all going with there erm and I noticed that I was putting a lot of the like sour salty spicy with opinion attitude but not necessarily being comfortable at having to continuously do that   
 erm yeah I mean er er yeah I'm quite so the the words at the top I guess with the words underneath because it doesn't feel like they're they're much of a connection you're looking to see whether d people do find consistent connection is that kind of the data analysis you'll do you'll look at kind of consistency and results and where there's groupings or 
 erm it's kind of a is that a really narrow way that you'll look at the data you'll look at it a lot more broadly 
 mhm 
 OK 
 OK 
 mm 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 OK interesting no it's funny it's sort of having two conversations in that yeah I think my brain was working away subconsciously on the on the kind of what er v er w what are they looking for which kind of created doubt so I tended to get into like set runs where I would run for a bit and then my brain would be like hang on a minute are you kind of don't wanna say trap cos it's obviously not a trap but   you know 
 are you are you f   are you falling into doing something you're not supposed to and it was kind of a bit like oh we need to er we need to stop and just have a think about this one and reassess and then very quickly very quickly would get you know cos of the repetitive nature of it very quickly would get back into the no the way to get through this is to make some associations and then just stick with them erm you can't kind of think in this test every single every single link er at a time yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
   
 yeah 
 no worries no worries ",comparison
how was the experiment?," confusing   
 but yeah it was fine it was good er er yeah I just didn't really feel like many of the words had like much in common with each other I suppose 
 erm it was funny I found myself I kind of found myself like  I think clicking similar every time  it came up but like yeah I'm not sure like I'm not sure like which like smoothed always made me think of boomerang for example but like I don't know smelly and spicy sometimes like   I was like mm   I dunno 
 I dunno   
 erm I suppose at the beginning I felt like a bit like yeah like anxious about like getting it right and wrong although it said like oh there's no correct answer it s was like I still kind of felt a bit mm er oh am I doing this right er but yeah I suppose like as I got into it I got quite like I don't know halfway through I kind of felt like there was a pattern oh oh yeah that one goes with that one and that one goes with that one and then I got one that that didn't match my pattern so then I   was just er then I just kind of got quite into it and relaxed and just thought oh that those words go with that word da da da 
 yeah so it was kind of like a three phase between phases I suppose that I went through   
 of like being quite stressed and then thinking there was like some kind of logic and then just kind of relaxing I suppose 
 yeah 
 well er I kind of felt like oh there yeah oh there's there's the pattern oh that's what you're supposed to do like I kind of f thought like oh I'm supposed to put that one with that one because  those work those words work together  but then I found one that like the words didn't work like you know it didn't meet my pattern so   I kind of yeah it was like oh yeah I've discovered the pattern but then it didn't work with the next one so I was like mm OK maybe I haven't found a pattern   
 er yeah 
 that made me think there was a pattern erm no it's like a few in row that were like that made me think it was a pattern it was like I don't know one of the words would I would easily use to like describe someone's opinion so then I would put it with opinion but then it would be like I don't know spicy and salty and like boomerang and consideration and I mm wouldn't put any of those words together   so then I was like 
 oh yeah that may maybe   maybe maybe my er logic isn't isn't sound and there's something else   at play   I don't know 
 yeah 
 OK 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah oh it just kind of felt like within me like within me like I dunno it felt very th for some for most of them it felt very kind of clear which one it was for me I don't know like yeah like two words would be come up and I'd be like oh no it's definitely not that one it's definitely that one   you know 
 it was really strange I don't know but I found myself like doing really simple patterns as well like erm I don't know er like erm like the esses like if it was like S S I found myself being like erm S S and then sharpner I'd always pick sharpner cos it was like S S S and it sounds good 
 I dunno but mm yeah that was like it's strange it's strange because it was like complete yeah like free choice but I felt like there was a very clear choice mostly with like I don't know it's strange like I felt I felt very kind of within myself like no it's definitely not that one   
 instinctive preference 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 mm of like feeling I mean like it ah mm yeah I suppose it all the way through I was kind of feeling like oh that one matches but it was only when I kind of like got rid of this feeling of like doing it right and wrong kind of probably like a third of the way through that like it started feeling like quite natural like when it's that one da da da da da 
 I suppose but yeah 
 it was quite like strongly either way or really strongly is the wrong word but I definitely like felt like a I don't know it's weird 
 that I was like yeah I was like drawn to one rather than the other 
 the what you mean the the two words felt balanced 
 or d like the word two words written and one word it felt like balanced   
 yeah like with one of the words it was like balanced with the other it was like odd 
 erm yeah but it was quite confusing cos I felt like I didn't know why like why why that one would be the odd one out I don't know why but yeah it felt like oh no that one's the  old one out  you know 
 that er   
 yeah absolutely 
   
 OK ",comparison
how was the experiment?," it was really interesting it was fun   erm I th t I I think I obviously this would be the case with everyone participating but while you're doing it you're very aware of wondering why you're doing it sort of thing so particularly with the word task as as my job is kind of words I am you know I'm I'm inclined to over think that   that sort of thing and yeah   
 that that I found I found it perhaps more d er difficult than I   than I should have done because I don't like putting words together that don't fit together naturally grammatically   so I don't like having to make a a choice between a a salty edge and a salty opinion   I you know I I erm so I I perhaps it my r er responses perhaps weren't as instinctive as they might have been because I had I was working on a process of least bad   
 a l  a least bad association than er good  and for some reason I took against boomerang and I was aware that I was  took  taken against boomerang I was again overthinking that I was giving boomerang a w er g a fair chance   
 yeah 
 well it I think because the practice ones boomerang didn't come up in the practice one so when I'd been d er overthinking the practice ones  and had been more nebulous  concept  concepts like edge  and opinion I had worked my way round to thinking how the adjectives c could apply to them s so when I got into the test and boomerang came along I n d yeah I I was worrying about whether I was being valid because they weren't instinctive responses sort of thing that I worked my way round to a sharpener potentially being a person or a drink or something and therefore more things could apply to it whereas the boomerangs just a boomerang so nebulous adjectives can't apply to it whereas opinion and considerations it it got easier because ad s soon  as soon as I had thought my way to there could be a smoothed consideration then whenever I saw a smoothed in consideration  I had er I had already said yep those two are allowed together sort of thing   
 definitely yes 
   is that not a g and then I was worrying that that was a bad thing for your experiment   
 oh 
 yeah 
 right yeah 
 right yeah 
 well I think it came round in the practising that I was that I er unfortunately I think I think there were only abstract nouns in the practising so I had s having spoken to you I had to think out a way whereby I could happily with in   within myself fit the adjective t with the with the noun I mean not not necessarily as a  spart  part of speech but I but through a rapid process of going well you could say someone had a salty opinion if it was a little bit o out of the ordinary and they're so I don't I don't suppose I was thinking of salty in a sensory sense but more in the sense of it you know a salty story or something like like that 
 er erm so having having I think just that that having agreed with myself  that a per certain adjective  could be used in a certain way and could be applied to that noun thereafter it was easier to do it and and almost two adjectives with t I feel that two adjectives one can be a bit superfluous like it could be a bit of sort of literary a literary flourish   almost so that if you were saying that someone had a salty opinion you could also say it was a smelly it you know having having agreed with myself that it could be salty then it could probably also be smelly as well   
 whereas with the with the boomerang which has as far as I know just got one meaning  there were a very few adjectives  that it it I was aware that I just couldn't apply any nebulous adjectives to it  I mean it could just about have been being salty  but then I had to go through a whole process of thinking  well then it would have had to dropped in the sea first  in order to be salty and I b I felt bad cos I did miss the opportunity for a sm salty smelly boomerang which was its one opportunity   and then d I I'd already clicked on the other one cos I'd er I'd seen t opinion   
 mm mm 
 ah I didn't even realise that actually that didn't even register with me as we were going along 
 actually I tell a lie the the only time I was aware of it being sensory was when it was edge because I had thought to myself somehow I associated given the adjectives I associated that with a drink and saying you could say that it had a bit of a salty edge to it or it had a bit of a something edge to it and that actual now I think about it that was very sensory that would that would be how I would establish whether I felt they could go with the word edge or not by well er no no er now I'm thinking about it more smoothed with sensory too yes I was definitely applying I was more ready to apply salty sour and smoothed to edge and sharpener than I was any of the other adjectives and I think that was because I had conceived them perhaps as slightly more sensory nouns 
 oh right 
 mm mm 
 yeah yeah 
 but ah er is is edge enough enough of a non abstract noun to be the other to be to be the other non abstract noun because or or w is edge specifically decided on because it is halfway between abstract and not cos I mean like a boomerang's absolutely a boomerang whereas s if someone's got an edge to them or something like that you know it's not that's where t I would've thought that was as as abstract as an opinion 
 yeah 
 mm 
 mm 
 ah 
   wow 
 ah yes yeah yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah   
 yeah no it it's really interesting w will you w  when when will you have written and everything up  is this a very long term project or r r will is it 
 yeah 
 oh that that would be lovely yeah that would be really interesting thank you 
 yeah 
 that's fine   
 no I don't think so well I mean if you're able to say I'm interested to know why why what the th different tasks meant mm but it 
 I mean or what no I not what they meant what what they're what they're used what you're looking at 
   
 mm 
 mm 
 oh oh right that's interesting yeah 
 yeah yeah yeah 
 mm 
 yeah 
 fascinating great well thank you that was fun   ",comparison
how was the experiment?," OK 
 erm that's a very open question isn't it   I think that er I I have a feeling that my profession is going to er sway the answer to this question quite a lot er so I'm a psychologist so the main part of my role is talking therapies erm so there's a lot of emphasis on kind of creative language and the use of metaphor within most therapies erm so yeah so I think we we use a lot of metaphors erm therapeutically with with the people that we're working with and probably also with each other because you just kind of get into the habit of of thinking in that   way erm so there's there's kind of room for like a bit of playfulness er with language and and with the the meaning of of things and and how kind of experiences are constructed erm so I think I'm I think I'm probably think more creatively than certainly like my family and friends in in the way that I in the way that I talk erm but I think my job probably has a lot to do with that 
 yeah of course 
 erm lots of things probably so I think it allows you to be like a bit playful in in one sense so erm you you know you c you can maybe bring up quite difficult erm emotions or concepts or theories even and and and and make it a bit more playful and and a bit more interactive and erm in in the way that you do it I think it also it also helps with like externalizing problems erm so you know if if you find a metaphor like er you probably heard like you know the black dog metaphor for depression erm so so kind of having having an external metaphor for for distress or or a a feeling or a behavior I think helps it to er it it to be externalized so it doesn't feel like it's a a problem within or something that needs fixed or changed within it's that it's something that's that's there and we can describe it and put words to it and and find the meaning erm and I think that's an a safer way to approach things sometimes erm  
 yeah yeah and yeah  and I think can  really personalize the meaning as well erm so you know like we might have like a a clinical word for like could use depression again for someone but you know that doesn't that doesn't carry meaning for everyone whereas kind of a cloud or a fog or more of like a kind of descriptive language where you might assign a colour to something or erm you know you might assign a name to it or just use a a swear word or you know it just it just kind of gives a bit more freedom to personalize the thing erm 
 I don't I mean I er have you got like a definition of creative language like    
 that's good   OK erm c er well this is well this is what I was wondering when I started talking I almost started kind of putting bits together and I was thinking I'm sure it's probably broader than just the use of metaphor when I'm sat across a room from someone   erm I think er when I think of the word creative I automatically think of like like colour and erm like not kind of not something practical or prescriptive something a bit more er an I don't really think and I can think of a word for it but I don't and I know you're nodding I don't know if you can kind of grasp what I mean well for the purpose of the audio recording I'm going to have a word for it I think but I think for me it it just becomes something a bit more so there's like a kind of a freedom for kind of bringing yourself into it or or feelings or emotions or experiences rather than a bland word I guess so I don't know any opportunity you'd have to do that so whether that is swearing and and kind of you know er er getting something out erm in in a way that allows you to get feelings out at the same time or erm like er some like a metaphor or something that brings like imagery to mind  or like outside the words maybes  erm story telling I I don't know if if that's kind of linked erm yeah like somebody narrative I guess 
   
 yeah   
 yeah 
 yeah yeah and I think I think storytelling as well er l it kind of fits not necessarily with kind of playing with language but mm but I guess what you've just said in terms of using it as a way to to kind of convey meaning or explore it y you know well a lot a lot of what I do at work is to just have someone share their story and I think that involves lots of different erm techniques but the the main one is is someone finding the words to describe what's happened to them or or what they're feeling  or what they want it to happen  erm and  I think maybes part of it yeah actually  cos if I think for if I think about kind of er being creative with language I think you stand alone and you can probably be quite creative with language in in the way that you might kind of express how you feel through poetry songs speech w or written language however that might be but there's also something about like dialogue I think and and a bit of the like dance or back and forth and how you kind of co-create that erm and I think it's where we have a different process but both both as creative as as the other I guess yeah  
 I think so I think especially thinking about the example of humour and and finding er a kind of phrase or using somebody's own words to be able to like introduce something a bit more difficult or or or something a bit controversial it I think it if you can do that with playful language such as using somebody's own language or or finding a metaphor or or using like a kind of I I don't know like a quote of a famous quote or or something I think you can you can say a bit more 
 than than you could if you were to just deliver it directly or or plainly erm yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah yeah and I think er also give a bit of power to the person that's said something as well so so you know sometimes er you just like in this context I guess I've rambled on and you've picked something up and you've delivered it back and it then it then places significance on it and and gives it a bit of power and I think in a therapeutic context that's r that can be really reassuring or or really kind of meaningful for someone to to have been heard and and also to kind of have their own their own not even experience but the way they've they've described that experience using language to be acknowledged and and kind of given a bit of a platform erm and we do that a lot like your one of the key things in therapy is like summarizing and in any type of interview I guess you know I y someone'll sit down and speak sometimes for an hour sometimes for ten minutes and without taking a breath and it's how you summarize it and and I guess part of that is picking people's words or strings of words that have stuck out or you know have kind of struck you or made you a bit more curious or erm or or kind of felt important and and I th that's probably like a r a large part of what I do but then you're right it gives you the freedom to explore that a little bit further erm which might be you know let's look at that in a different way or erm you know let's think about a c a colour or a memory or a song that l l links to that and and and I think words are quite often embedded in that erm yeah I I mean cos there's certain colours that that have certain words associated with them and would you know I th gave someone today like this colour wheel that's got like a kind of inner circle of like core pain feelings like fear erm sadness joy pleasure and then it's got like ripples out but each section's in a different colour and obviously the sadness one's blue and it goes to like a lighter shade of blue and you've got words such as like guilt and shame erm like and then yeah and then even like tertiary words like feeling neglected or whatever and they're all they're all together in that blue group and then you've got like a yellow group and and then that gives people the f the kind of freedom to then use a colour to describe a feeling so even in that sense 
 it it's like a shortcut almost sometimes having a kind of more personal I guess creative definition of something for you is a bit of a shortcut and once people get to know that shortcut y it means something between between you both erm I dunno if that makes sense 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah yeah yeah it's it's interesting that just even thinking about like what you just said there numerous times working with young people especially you you know you you spend a lot of time working on these shortcuts so you might do like an emotions thermometer that has I d er a colour scale but also has kind of certain words on or things that are associated so you know on on kind of the angry end of of the thermometer you might have like the colour black or red you you might have images that are particularly triggering or or names of people that that bring about those emotions and and and then that's used to communicate to either family members or or staff if erm if you're on a ward setting that mm this is where I'm at right now erm and and obviously when you become well any intense emotion but with anger when it starts to build you then you lose language is one of the things that goes isn't it you you know you can't communicate effectively to s to someone erm when you're in any form of distress so you need to be creative with how you tell someone what you're feeling or how you're feeling erm yeah and I guess you can do that without verbalizing it as well can't you you know a lot of people find very creative ways to get their needs met erm yeah whether that's certain behaviors or noticing that when you make a certain stand or raise your voice you get a certain reaction erm you know you learn that that er that kind of gets the desired outcome and and gets whatever the need is met erm yeah it's f it's ah yeah because I guess creative language maybe doesn't doesn't tap into kind of the nonverbal stuff so much erm or maybe it does I don't know   
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 no I suppose it's a bit harder to kinda measure or kind of draw meaning from isn't it but there's certainly er you know you know ways of of er of communicating I mean think about like an eye roll er   like that's that's communicating a very clear message erm 
 and and and that I I guess like is or feels to me anyway like it kind of fits into that more creative communication like when you're in a situation you kind of see a a way of verbally sharing how you feel or getting out of that situation or whatever then you've got that set of kind of more creative nonverbal strategies that you can use erm yeah  
 mhm  
 yeah that's true 
 yeah yeah 
   
 mhm 
 mhm 
 yeah well I think er it I mean er I guess kind of more generally I think most people if you name a colour would very quickly  kind of associate and emotion  with that so think about this saying oh I'm feeling a bit blue you know that has a lot of that has a lot of meaning erm and people say that because it's a bit milder than saying I'm I feel depressed or or my mood is really low it's it it I think has a bit of safety it erm p p perhaps take some of the kind of severity out of it erm but definitely feels mm more erm relatable er maybe is the word erm so I think er you know everyone er I I imagine if you say what colour is associated with anger would probably say red you know you've got this saying oh I just saw red I couldn't do anything else so you've got the red rag to a bull mm er expression so I think they're they're c really commonly used the kind of general ones erm but I think in a therapeutic context you possibly get to explore that a bit more so it might come about by well like there's this technique called externalizing that erm we'd use a lot in systemic therapy which is just  creating an identity for a feeling out with you  and and mm part of exploring that is what if this thing looked like something what it what does it look like so you know if your depression was sat in the room with us what does it look like erm what colour is it like you know is it does it float is it heavy is it soft is it rough erm and most you know there's always there's common themes of  like black clouds or fog or mist or like storm  you know those kind of things are associated with erm with low mood and then y you know you might have things such as kind of lightning or erm like waves being er w associated with like ang er like more kind of worries or erm or anxiety I guess but it it makes it er that it makes it takes it out of you I think it takes it out of your body and and gives you like mm a bit of power over it so I think you know you wanna be in control of that thing so you know if you think that it's a black cloud that's over here and you can think about it it comes closer and that's when I start to feel X Y Z erm it allows you to play with it a bit more so then you can start to have the conversations about right so when the black cloud isn't so black when it's grey what are you doing what does it look like what does your day look like erm when the black cloud is over you what you know what's that like erm how can we make the black cloud smaller I think it it just it gives a nice way of of pushing that a bit erm and I think sometimes that can be a bit playful like if you especially with children  and I think might always need to be better at it with adults  so I think adults lose some of that playfulness because you you get it more with children about the drawing like big monsters erm to be their worries or whatever and I think it's a bit harder to do with adults erm but just as important I think erm 
 yeah I think I deviated from your question just about colours there but it just made me think of all the kind of bigger descriptions or the kind of imagery that that comes with giving something a colour or a name or and being a bit playful with that erm 
   yeah 
 no that's OK 
 yeah 
   yeah erm well er well I think I like all of those things and I'm not I don't er I used to keep a like a one line a day diary for five years where I'd just kind of like write down a a like a thought or something that happened or and it was falling to bits and I finished it this Christmas it was a Christmas present five years ago and I keep saying to myself I must find another thing to to to replace that because it was like such a cathartic process just just writing down every day  and you know ask people every day at work to keep diaries  or log log things I d like I do think there's a lot of of usefulness in that erm but it wasn't particularly creative erm I'd I'd love I think I'd love to be able to write like poetry or or kind of do a bit more creative writing but I just I don't I don't think ap apart from kind of like metaphor and and kind of understanding I think personally it doesn't come out so easily for me verbally erm I think I'm I much prefer art and erm I do a lot of kind of drawing and painting erm murals lots of 
 yeah this we just moved into this house recently so I drew this this is my makeshift office until I can er buy wallpaper so 
 oh thank you well I very much just express myself through pen and paper really rather than words erm I do always kind of want to be better at that but like I say it just doesn't come as easily for me erm but music you mentioned music I absolutely love music and find it quite powerful erm like I spoke with someone the other day actually about how there's certain songs that just bring such strong emotions for me that I'm like why do I listen to these songs because I was in a great mood before I put them on    them now I'm like driving along like with a lump in my throat  but there's  there's just kind of some pieces of music  that really do like just kind of touch me a bit erm yeah 
   
 erm well I did it at school for like GSCE and a  all I wanted to be an art therapist  but erm that costs a lot of money to train  as as art therapist  and whereas the NHS pay for your clinical doctorate so I just went down that route instead erm but I do I absolutely love art erm like all types of it as well not just s some like I you know I love going to art galleries and looking at kind of really old traditional pieces and then I love to just chuck paint on a canvas as well 
 yeah 
 no that's alright ",comparison
do you feel like you use language creatively?," do I feel like I use language creatively mm does it matter the context or just in er in general 
 OK OK well having been at university now for oh God almost five years wow almost five years it's th I think that has shaped a lot of how I use language as a whole I mean obviously y you're learning it in school that does shape how you use language but I think having to be so precise and concise with language in an academic sense has meant that mm I don't know if it's creative but I have had to you know make my sort of language very formal very sort of rigid to the point where you know I I will I won't use abbreviations because obviously you get penalised for using stuff like that in academic work and you just can't use them so in terms of my language being creative I would say that's probably er been damaged a little sort of having to write academically only because creative writing as sort of a er I mean that you know it's like stereotypical creative writing so things like you know poetry or what have you aren't really appropriate so I'd say that I may be not as creative in terms of my language as I have been in the past but I would say that my language as a whole is wider and more extensive now because of having to use so much academic verbiage if you will 
 erm I wouldn't necessarily  let's that  th er oop   tongue tied I wouldn't necessarily say that they're at odds but psychology specifically at least for me creative writing doesn't really have a point or like a purpose within it because at least as I understand it creative writing is very sort of fluid can be very informal academic psychological academic writing mm should be more rigid and sort of professional not to say that creative writing isn't professional but erm I would say that especially if you're doing quantitative work with stats and other you know graphs whatever creative writing doesn't really have a point to it because that's not the point of quantitative research I I focus mainly on qualitative research which is the interviews and stuff and erm it does there is an element of creativity in it because it in it involves a lot of interpretation of what people are saying so I guess it I guess if that is kind if that is part of creative writing I guess that it makes qualitative more creative but I would say as a whole psychological academic writing isn't very creative because that's not the point of that form of language I'd say it's more more sort of informative and scientific 
 yeah 
 erm why do I think that is erm well I suppose it's erm w look to any other sort of harder science like biology or chemistry or physics creative writing as I've described it at least isn't really appropriate at all because you're not really it doesn't really matter sort of what the language is so long as you're stating the facts and you're being concise about what you're saying I sup I mean I suppose creative writing can be that but again like from my understanding f sort of  facts and figures and erm statistic whatever  all that sort of stuff doesn't really have a place in the hard sciences so I'd say that for the soft sciences like psychology like I said if it depending on the discipline would depend would sort of influence the sort of writing  so like a bit a like lot what I said  with the qualitative and quantitative differences but erm yeah  
 I have 
 erm in the broader sense I would say that it involves a lot of sort of erm oh what does oh   now I'm thinking about it I don't actually   erm well I would say that it's f sort of like it's I th I don't know if this sort of works as a definition but it's very sort of fluid you sort of you s it's well it's like a story really sort of it you let it l sort of lead you rather than you just putting it down as sort of facts creative writing is uses a lot of erm as far as I'm aware anyway as far as I understand uses a lot of erm informal language erm a lot of sort of nuanced language as well and I don't think that is part of that you know that is part of creative writing which is why it's different from other types of writing like academic because it doesn't necessarily it doesn't matter it doesn't necessarily really matter how you interpret it because it's supposed to be interpreted you know in your own ways whereas academic writing as a contrast or I guess they are contrasted then yeah er academic writing it's not really up for interpretation it mostly it's more sort of this is what this is and there is no interpreting that like this is just what it is  where  it's creative writing you can say things in different ways you can say opposite things but mean the same thing you can have have like metaphors and similes and stuff like that where that is appropriate where in other instances it isn't 
 erm how do I feel erm mm I I don't think I've ever really been a creative writer in any sense of the word er to be honest erm in school at least for me creative writing was something that was em emphasised and looked at a lot but I was never really interested in that I was always more interested in the science sciences erm and like history and stuff so where creative writing isn't really part of that so in in terms of how it's how itâ€™s er f how I feel about my not being not erm creatively writing I wouldn't say it really has hasn't really had an effect because it's never been something I've done a lot of where I've had the ch if I've had the erm the choice to I'd rather write write in a nuanced way that is more academic and factual 
 OK erm 
 ambiguity in terms of oh it in terms of what 
 yeah 
 oh yeah I s I see 
 oh yeah I'd agree that yeah creative writing can be more ambiguous whereas other forms of writing are sort of look a lot at clarity and you know the lack of misinterpretation as it were   I just I was just thinking about sort of like erm   like Shakespearean plays and stuff if they were written academically or in a formal way they would make no sense and they'd be so boring   
 that's ah that's funny 
 it's er it's er b creative writing is a more interesting and fun way to write because you can an you can just do whatever you want with it whereas you know yeah   
 well it's just because it th it you can just do whatever you want with it whereas again I keep going back to it but like with my university work you can't just do whatever you want with the way you write stuff you literally have to follow rules and regulations with how you write your work and which is reflective of how papers and journals and articles want people to write journals and articles which is based on years and years and years of academic research and you know what have you that has been cultivated over a long period of time that ensures that you there is there is no possible way for you to misinterpret what someone is saying whereas because you don't have those constraints with creative writing it can be more fun to write it because you know you can do whatever you like or more so with other forms of writing 
 er yeah I would I would say so only because I found sort of English and er s you know sort of more I don't want to say creative they're sort of the more well I guess so yeah the subjects that used more creative writing I didn't find those as interesting as sort of science and you know more academic stuff I've always been more academically inclined I suppose not that erm those subject you know more creative subjects can't be academic but in terms of how they write stuff I've always been more interested in the academically written subjects 
 erm I don't know really I've I I've always been that sort of way erm I I I've always  be had  erm you know like do you know like those big like paperback books of like erm nature or sort of like erm er ah you know like animals and stuff you know like in blue planet or like do you know what I'm talking about like a big 
 yeah ah yeah yeah but like with more pictures   I've always  I've always it liked those sort of erm books  when I was younger and I still have a load a lot of  those sort of books  now  I have actual funnily enough  been more interested in the more creative writing stuff recentlybut in terms of reading it that is I've  I've always been  interesting  in reading at more creative writing  but when I was younger especially I preferred sort of more academic sort of documentarian style stuff 
 yes 
 oh yeah yeah I'd I'd I would say that I'd be more to the former only because I've been doing academic writing for so long that I don't really I'm I wouldn't say I can't do it but I'm more inclined to write academically than I would creatively   if I were to try and you know write some sort of like story or something now it wouldn't be very good   because it would just be you know it wouldn't be erm as sort of fluid and you know creative in the way that creative writing is because that's not what I'm used to doing 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 erm well I think a major part of it is I think I wouldn't necessarily call it a fear but I don't like I pe I don't like being misinterpreted so academic writing is a very big is you know is obviously like I said is very big on making sure you're as clear and your writing is as clear as possible so it can't be misinterpreted whereas as we know a lot of creative writing especially stuff written years and years ago in new social contexts gets very misinterpreted and very sort of you know can g w be quite damaging if they were written now 
 and so creative writing is very sort of erm dependent on the social context whereas academic writing can be but because it's written in factual ways  you sort of know that reading it  whereas creative writing is less obvious in that way 
 yeah 
 yeah 
   
 well I I'll give you I'll give you five more minutes    
 oh actually ten   I'll give you ten more minutes 
 that's all right   
 yeah 
 yeah 
 I I think writing and language are very much intertwined because you can't really have one without the other 
 yeah 
 well speech is well OK well actually we could start with writing first writing you can only go as far as what is on the page you know if there's er if you know if you have a paragraph in front of you that can be if creative writing now if that can be interpreted in different ways that can only be created in as many ways as it's written you know because writing doesn't necessarily have a context whereas language does you know if you're talking to someone you can you can see how you're supposed to interpret if they're saying something in like a positive way and you know the body language is you know comfort you know like positive then you know that oh well they're saying that you know it it it is like erm if you tell a joke and your body language is positive you know that that's supposed to be funny whereas if someone says something that sounds like a joke but they don't have that sort of positive body language and you're like oh maybe that's an insult instead so I'd say that creative writing is very sort of erm social er has a very big emphasis on context but language regardless of what the language is has an even bigger emphasis on that context especially creative language 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 oh absolutely yeah I mean you can say er since creative writing and language can be interpreted and is supposed to be interpreted in many different ways there are many different ways people can interpret it and they can interpret it in bad ways you know erm I mean creative language like I mean  if someone from me example  or I don't get offended by anything really but if someone were to say er it's sort of like a a sort of a gay joke if I was in on the conversation then I would find it funny whereas someone else could find that offensive so it's very much sort of yeah it is it's very much erm misinterpretation is a very big part of language especially creative language because unless you're cos you know it because of that misinterpretation if that's that's the whole it's like a double-edged sword creative language is creative because you can interpret it in different ways it's like with critique people can critique it more in in many different ways because it's something cr you've created so critique is a natural part of I would say part of that 
 you know obviously we get I know mm I get  create cr er critiqued  all the time for academic wri er ap er academic writing and language but erm that's not necessarily the same thing because if I've if someone's misinterpreted what I've said it's because I've not said the right phrase or sort of you know I've not used the right terminology whereas creative language and writing can be interpreted interpreted in so many different ways that there's basically no one way to interpret it including negative 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 erm I I I think it would depend on what needed to be changed erm I ah ah I y know I erm I would say that is quite a a creative part of academic writing where you can obviously if you need to write stuff in different ways that is that c that is creative but I would say that it's not creative writing it's more of a creative way of writing academic writing if that makes sense   
 because you can write academic writing in different ways that doesn't make it creative writing 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 mhm yeah 
 oh absolutely yeah absolutely like I said with the er like with psychology and quantitative and qualitative differences sort of stats versus sort of re er interviews and stuff I know they're not different genres ah they're er different subgenres of the same discipline so obviously the genre is very dic the genre dictates how you like creatively write or not creatively in more academic circumstances 
 yeah 
 in terms of  creating er creative wr er language and writing done being done creatively  rather than it being creative writing I would say I would do that a lot because I mean people lecturers for example will want you to write a piece of a piece of research in specific ways that then that you can write that in many different ways because you know you pe individuals individuals have different ways of writing stuff doesn't make it creative writing because obviously if it's for a university you know like a psychology sort of piece of research it's all academic that w p er individual inter er interpretation of the sort of parameters of what they want means that you're very unlikely  to say th see the seem same  two papers because people are creative with the way that they write for academic research and oh er the same with language 
 OK 
 yeah 
 right right 
 I would s er I would say what the AI is doing is presenting facts without nuance because the whole point of writing and language to people is that we can interpret things different ways even regardless of if it's sort of erm creative language or academic language what have you we all interpret things different ways it's just it j it it is just the amount of interpretation that there is between the different kinds of language so what I'd say that er that AI is doing is presenting things in an academic way but not in a creative way within that it is literally er y you know you can present s you know like statistics you can present them but if you're literally just presenting statistics without and you know without telling someone what that means then obviously that's not gonna make any sense    
 so it's er yeah like I said it's just statistics 
 yeah 
 no problem thanks  
 OK ",comparison
do you feel like you use language creatively?," mhm yeah sometimes   I think 
   
 erm so I'm quite an avid reader erm I read mm around all different subjects so sort of fiction nonfiction medical like all different kinds of books so I try and sort of like you know obviously take in take on board the language that I've sort of learnt and that and erm and in most situations try and use it in everyday life you know just sort of use words that are you know   a bit more complicated perhaps and a bit more creative yeah mm   yeah 
 yeah I think it's just erm er b because the language is such a beautiful thing and obviously you know we're er we have we have the ability to use different phrases and we can be quite descriptive in our language as well I think modern day language we tend to s it just sort of go straight to the point we don't really sort of you know er  confabulate  anything so it's quite nice to be able to use a little bit of descriptive language when we're when we're talking to each other and that's sort of gone out the of general conversation now so it's quite nice to be able to you know be a little bit creative and descriptive in your language 
 yeah it's difficult really it depends on who you're talking to if you're if you're talking to other people that are sort of like again avid readers or if they're if they're quite well read then you tend to find that they'll sort of follow along and your your language sort of bounces off each other but if you're talking to people that are you know they're not that well read or they're not really into I dunno they're not really into reading or or creative writing or whatever er y yeah a lot of the the word seems sort of lost on them or they kind of give you a bit of a   a bit of a lost look there as if they don't really know what you're talking about or they just kind of nod along as if they sort of understood the word but I don't   think they really knew what the word was that you were saying yeah   like 
 erm yeah they sort of let it ride really they think it's that it may be on their path it's just that they don't want to come across it and they're like they don't know the word or that you know they seem unintelligent or or you know feel that they're not you know not well read but they just sort of yeah they kind of just nod along and then yeah they don't really sort of say anything really whereas I'd rather them say like oh what does that mean or   so you know you can kind of talk about it further really yeah yeah 
   I get that 
 mm well I s I mean the thing is is I suppose if you've read something and then you've you've kind of seen a word that maybe you've not used in a while you think mm yeah that's quite a good word and then you I think you tend to sort of in your conversation the next few times  you'd maybe sort throw that in there  because it's something you think that's quite like it's a really enriching word you know you just sort of throw it in there or yeah erm I would yeah possibly like if you if you you're searching for a word in conversation that you want to describe something I'd maybe like just grab my own you know descriptive words but yeah er I suppose if you're reading something particularly if it's around a certain subject or you know you've read like a certain type of book then you'd maybe start using that word in in general conversations because you like it and you've not heard it in a while you know   yeah 
 erm yeah because er y I suppose if you're talking to people about a certain subject and there's like er just a I feel like a bog standard normal word that you could use or like a more descriptive word that you could use that's a bit more creative I think yeah it just seems think it's nice to sort of embellish the conversation a little bit with that with that creative word you know it just makes the the whole conversation a little bit richer yeah mhm 
 yeah mm mhm it's sort of like giving them an alternative to using  I suppose of like you say  we sort of have this core I don't know we like very ap  we have these core thing of words  that we just use sort of use day in day out and I yeah I suppose the conversation becomes quite monotonous if you're kind of using those same words all the time but if you can sort of throw in a few different words I don't know maybe people don't realize it at the time but if they absorb that and then perhaps they might go home and they might be talking to their other half and then throw a word in there and they'd be like ooh that's different   you know yeah yeah it's just sort of enriching enriching a conversation and hopefully like sort of paying it forward a little bit maybe as well so we can we can you know er benefit from from the different different types of conversation mm mhm 
 erm yeah possibly I mean I to be honest obviously with COVID at the minute and you know with none of us are going anywhere are we   that's the thing for me it's really more just like sort of talking to people in work so you know er oh I do a lot of night shifts that's that's like my thing as a   do night shifts we tend to find that obviously on the night shift you do have a lot of time   to fill which obviously would be like   some conversations can become quite banal you know it's just sort of like the day to day thing and and it's nice to just get onto a bit of a topic that's a bit more you know abnormal maybe you know something that's not so run of the mill and it's nice to see it like I say if you get talk to somebody that's like a bit of a an avid reader or if they're you know they're interested in different topics it's nice to you know have a bit of a different conversation rather than just like day to day m mundane   stuff you know 
 mm yeah possibly all three I mean erm erm I w   when I was little I was always into like sort of creative writing like at school or erm I was much more into literature than I was th erm numbers but I always think they ah you're either like a words or a numbers type of person so I've always been into like sort of like you know when I was little writing stories or erm you know just I forget reading so for me it's kind of yeah it's mm probably a way of expressing myself that I've always been a little bit more I d I quite like to  flourish the conversation  with a few different words w yeah maybe it's that er it's a way of me expressing myself just a little bit you know differently than everybody else I would say a lot of the time now I think maybe like you sort of lapse into like textual speak or erm you know we use like sort of you know a lot of shortened words because we just can't be bothered   basically so it's really interesting yeah just like sort of  flourish the conversation  with something that's a little bit you know a little bit more descriptive like I say and then yeah just er I wouldn't say it's even about teaching people or I don't know if I'm erm trying to get other people to use different terminology it's just to it's just to liven up the conversation a little bit just but not yeah not just this like text speak all the time or you do you do find a lot of people tend to be like quite erm you know monotone just like sort of one word answers or you know if that's the word when you're on a shift then you sort of talking to somebody you literally get like one word answers back or just yeah and then mm you know it just makes makes makes the night go a lot slower but if you're able to sort of have a a full on you know backwards and forwards conversation with a little bit more descriptive language then it just makes the night a bit more interesting then mm   
 yeah yeah 
 yeah the main issues are on the ability to sort of you know be able to like construct a full sentence as opposed just yeah alright then see you later or you know   it's just like we w I think like the the quickest route possible or the easiest route possible sometimes especially at work e-mailing or if we're texting or we just sort of wanna get get straight to the point and you know we don't mm we don't really do anything else other than   that straight to the point kind of thing you know yeah 
 mm yeah I think so yeah cos er as I say I've always been into literature and that you know in school like really enjoyed you know English language and literature and I think yeah we've sort of like er well not everybody obviously but I think w you know modern day we've kind of like lost that ability to enjoy language just for the sake of language you know just to enjoy words I tend to find if I'm reading a book and I come across the word that looks like mm I dunno what that word means I've actually got like erm a book with a like a list of words that like I don't know what they mean so I like look them up and then I've got like this little sort of list of you know words but they're just like g er amazing words you know you just don't come across in everyday language you know   yeah 
 mm erm let me just I've I know I've got them in a little er in a little folder wait a sec   er yeah I always I was a bit sad just sort of writing these down but then you kind of like this it's such a you know the English language is so rich and we just like you know  there's a word that we come across and we don't really we don't really do anything with them  so let's have a look er mm   so yeah erm like on this page I've got erm accidie A double C I D I E which means erm apathy spiritual or mental sloth   yeah and then there's like a weird yeah it's like really bizarre and then erm er there's another word phocine P H O C I N E which means relating to or affecting to the true earless seals   so randomly just relating to seals I don't actually know where I got that from that book and then nictating which means to blink so that's like another word for blink   is to nictate which is just like such a random   word and yeah oh I've got the the first one was ah I dunno I'm not dunno whether I'm pronouncing it right it's accidie A double C I D I E and that was spiritual or mental sloth or apathy   yeah 
 mm yeah possibly or e even I dunno yeah Greek or French maybe I'm not sure but erm yeah   yeah and there's just yeah there's pages and pages that go on like that there's erm random yeah random ones er apotropaic means usual ritual or other magical means including charms or incantations to avert evil or bad luck   mm 
 erm only I'd I'd say sort of only in the past couple of years to be honest cos I think erm at school obviously you've sort of like you're you're not really reading for pleasure are you you're kind of like   forced to read what the curriculum kind of tells you and then I've always been like a you know read for pleasure but I think just it's only really appealed to me in the last couple of years just to do that to sort of make a little you know make a list of of yeah of just words that sort of just sound quite nice and yeah and they just appeal to me so I've just kept a little a little dictionary of them yeah but   mm yeah 
 to be honest I've not done it for a while I mean er I d I did try a little while ago but I kind of got out of the habit I think in school it was just kind of like ah I dunno just would get an idea that just popped into my head and then just kind of wrote around it really erm but it yeah it's something that I've not done for a good I I keep meaning to get back to it and I kn I know that they always sort of say like write about something that you know so it's kind of just trying to you know   pick a subject that's yeah that that would be er that something I would er I'd know about and then try writing about it but I think it's harder when obviously when you're older and you're working and you've got other sort of commitments going on it is quite difficult to sort of just sit down and put things to paper isn't it whereas I think when you're little it's just like a more of a spontaneous you know an idea pops in your head and you think ooh   and you just start writing about it you know yeah yeah whereas er   me now I'd maybe overthink it a bit too much if I was gonna start like a story or like write something I'd probably maybe think about it a little bit too much maybe and then it would almost I dunno maybe take the pleasure out of it more so than when I was younger if you know what I mean yeah 
 possibly yeah because I think when you're little you just kind of like you just run with it don't you sort of like write something down sounds alright just carry on with that you know just sort of sort of like tell the story but yeah I think possibly as an adult if you were kind of like you know creative writing you would always be like self editing and thinking that doesn't sound right or that doesn't sound grammatically correct or you know trying to t yeah  self correct before you sort of finished the paragraph  maybe takes that spontaneity out of the out of the storytelling I suppose which I suppose is the thing that   you know if you're writing isn't it you know   yeah 
 mm yeah I don't know really alm er er I suppose it would be the way that you'd erm you'd possibly have to just write the the story and you kind of think it and then at the end go back and just kind of like edit it you know and then just sort of look for any any mistakes or something that doesn't sound right maybe but yeah probably never got that that far into it   these days of you know sort of got to the point of writing enough to you know sort of get a whole story together or you know or then   and edit at the end you know   yeah   
 I would yeah I would've liked to I mean I've sort of had a few ideas over the years it sort of pops into me head and you're like write the idea down but then it's kind of like then it goes out me head again and then I forget all about it but yeah and I suppose it's one of those things you think oh when I've got the time or when I can sit down and you know have a few weeks just   to write it but I don't I don't think it's ever gonna happen it's just one of those things if you're gonna do it you kinda have to just jump in and get going I suppose mm   mm yeah 
 erm to be honest ab a lot of what I read these days is actually nonfiction so it tends to sort of like you know yeah like sort of erm like it felt like it like say medical books or all different stuff really it's like all different subjects but it tends to be non fiction I do like short stories but I tend to find that some are av a I've read a few and there'd be like a few collections that have sort of left me a bit disappointed so I'm kind of like ooh I tend to sort of     from the short stories erm and poetry yeah sort of in and out of it really it's I w er I wouldn't say it's my preference to be honest poetry but erm yeah I do like the odd the odd poem   here and there yeah erm yeah yeah maybe nonfiction's sort of like er m my go to thing really yeah   yeah 
 a bit of everything absolutely everything it doesn't really matter like an stuff about nature animals psychology the medical stuff there's just like like trying to look at the books now there's like yeah just bits of everything really yeah any any anything that just like sort of catches my eye and then I tend to I go on like erm there's like a a website I dunno if you've heard of it Goodreads it's like sort erm a review website yeah and then you can kind of you know if you review a book on there it'll kind of say like oh  this is kind of like it a referral thing  if you like this book you might be into this kind of b er er you know people'll name  some of the books that they've read similar  so you sort of like end up with a little s yeah collection of stuff that you might wanna read so yeah just tends to be a bit of everything bit of any sort of subject really   yeah nothing's off the table   mm mhm 
 mm yeah yeah I think it depends on the writer like the author and it depends on the subject cos I mean for some of the subjects obviously the author it's th they're quite dry because they're quite often they're not sort of you know they're not looking at the layperson to read it it's more of an academic text possibly so that they tend to be a little bit more dry and language possibly and maybe a little bit harder to get through but yeah you do you do find that there's yeah you know that there's some subjects that w there'll be non fiction books but they're still you know there's still a flourish in the writing and there's still like their descriptive elements are really you know they're they're quite pretty   yeah   yeah 
 mhm yeah I think to be honest that probably makes sense but like teaching tools well like you just said you know if you sort of if you use a descriptive element about something then it you do find it you know a little bit easier to sort of remember facts and I know it er you know lots of places use like acronyms don't they for like remembering certain things or yeah erm erm I can't think of any now   but you know how you sort of like you know never eat shredded wheat for like North East South West kind of thing you know that's the sort of thing we were taught in school you know erm mm but yeah er you know there's th there I think there's been like sort of a few books where you know there's been a bit of a crossover between a fictional author or like just a a regular author kind of writing with the nonfiction type elements so like obv like the likes of Bill Bryson for example I think he's he's written a book about the body you know sort of more like the body erm an occupant's guide to the body and his is kind of like he goes through this system and it's more like erm it's more like obviously like a journey like a nature journey through the human body but because he makes it humourous I suppose it it would be you know if you were using it as a teaching tool it would be a lot easier for people to remember stuff because it's like there's a bit of humour in there and there's like you know sort of like he makes it you know quite interesting rather than just like you say this is the femur this is the heart or you know there's a always a little story around    language make it more memorable I suppose  but   and yeah yeah   
 mm erm what   I there's I it just I'm always like I feel sad for people that sort of like have no creativity if you know what I mean like my my husband's an artist so like his creativity is more   like a visual thing whereas  man my intensity  were in words but   like I always find it funny if you're talking to somebody about like I dunno it sounds really random but like dreams and they say like I don't really have any dreams at all and you might have li I like have particularly like vivid dreams or I'll have like this so like sort of like a film reel or whatever and I always just think well like if you er I suppose if there's a complete lack of creativity in life whatever aspect whether it's dreams or painting or reading or you know arts and crafts I just think like it's a bit of a shame if people have got you know no creativity in their life at all I just think it's such a it's such an enriching thing to have you know and I just think it's sad if people haven't got it   yeah yeah 
 yeah yeah I'd say so and you know especially again if you're sort of like describing things to people I think particularly yeah sensory language is a is a is a big thing you know erm I think like when p if like I dunno people sort of describe something that they've eaten or that they've seen or what have you it's like again you know p people tend to stick to something that's like quite like an easy adjective or just like a very plain adjective where it's quite nice to sort of like get that fl if somebody can describe to you as much as possible what their sensory perception of it was it's makes it so much more you know you can you can relate to that yourself can't you you know mm er rather than just saying it was sweet or it was sour you know they you can give it like er a bigger description you know and just yeah y you get a better sense of what it was that they were experiencing yeah 
 erm no not that I can think of no but I was gonna say you know the er the other part of your erm the research that you're doing n is it to were you looking at the link between schizophrenia and creative writing as in erm I was just cos I know obviously I've been reading about that I actually read a book about schizophrenia and it was sort of erm they were they were relating or thinking about a word salad or the glossolalia which I was wondering whether that was part of the of the sort of the you know the research that we're doing whether there was that sort of word association or you know a a link between the two   yeah 
 mm erm I I find it fascinating to be honest and erm as I say I'm I'm a nurse so when I did my nurse training I actually came across it with a patient that erm that was like was very sort of florid erm schizophrenic and had this like word salad this stuff and I was absolutely I was fascinated it a th er   I I was sort of like fearful   and fascinated at the same time it was probably one of the most like bizarre experiences I've come across but it w at the same time I actually th I actually thought to myself what's going on in the brain for that sort of association to be taking place between those words and in such like sort of quick fire succession as well it was like just sort of firing off words sort of one after the other and it I actually found it really fascinating but yeah I've I've I've always that's sort of always baffled me really to be honest how the brain kind of like makes that association and then yeah w er and I remember thinking to myself that like that could be  cut to  put to good use   in some way I suppose you know these sort of you know the patient involved was coming up with some absolutely mad words you know that were just yeah some of them were like proper words some of them were completely made up words and I just I yeah I found it really fascinating to be honest but er that's why I'm sort of interested in research like this it's just I I actually I find it so fascinating you know with th h  what's the human brain's capable of  and sort of how that fine line between you know erm sort of well madness in inverted commas you know and creativity and you know there's been a lot of like sort of you know history of that hasn't you know sort of like that fine line between you know sort of you know madness and illness I suppose yeah yeah I do find it fascinating   yeah but 
 mm yeah I mean as I say it th erm as a I'm I'm erm a trained nurse but just in adult so general adult erm er nursing and obviously you have do as part of your nurse training you have to actually do like a placement either in erm learning disabilities or mental health so this is like back this is probably like 2000 2001 erm and I was only like sort of in my twenties at the time so I'd never actually come across any sort of mental illness or mental health issues at all erm and then obviously you're just sort of like put into this setting where you're you   know you don't really know much about you've only sort of read you know read the basics around that erm around the subject and yeah I just found it really fascinating they would erm the patients would be s be able to see a psychiatrist once a week and this particular patient it was it was quite sad for him and obviously it's it's an anonymous thing you know that erm but this particular patient w in his florid psychosis had thought he could fly erm and thought he had the ability he was like a superhero so he'd jumped out through the window   and he'd actually like         and it was just this sad story er that I found I was like oh my God you know you just it like beyond your comprehension of what you can sort of think wow   and then obviously when he used to go into like these the psychiatry meetings every week I don't think he actually had any idea of what the meeting was about really so he would just he would basically pick up on a word that the psychiatrist said and that would be it that would be his his you know his cue to just he would just go on for about twenty minutes just one word to another to another to another and they'd they'd sound similar but there would be no relation between the words whatsoever the meaning or the structure there was no structure to the sentence   there were no sort of paragraphs you know it was just I think he thought that he was making sense but I we would just kind of sit there like kind of you know open-mouthed just like wow and it yeah for me it was just it was just such erm it was like a teaching tool in one way where I just kind of thought like how I did I dunno how you'd manage like that sort of thing how do you manage somebody that's that their way of thinking is so disordered you know it was just yeah I f I found it really erm I found it fascinating but I also thought it was quite saddening as well I suppose just to think you know what do you do with erm a patient like that you know how do you sort of manage that really it was yeah it was quite erm quite baffling   yeah but er yeah it's quite a seminal moment for me I suppose cos I'd never really sort of come across that kind of you know that f florid psychosis before and that yeah it was it was interesting   to say the least but I think th it it's probably th it stuck with me so much because it was so much out of my ordinary you know comfort zone as well and it's erm yeah it was just something that stuck with me really   yeah 
 kind of sad I'm trying to sort of need to think of like stuff that he'd do sort of erm   you know just kind of like even l like put two words tog I d dunno like erm ah I dunno he'd say something about like doll dolly Dolly Parton da da da Parton th er like partridge da da an th kind of like the words would just kind of like they'd just sort of flow for ah er in in his sort of mind the words were flowing and they were like flowing really sort of rhythmically but they had kind of no meaning to one another they were just s like say a couple of the letters in the words would sound similar erm it it and it's it's one of those it's kind of hard to think of what he would say afterwards but it was just yeah just kind of like words that sound slightly similar or there would be a few letters similar to each other that would just go together and it was just ba ba ba b but you know it was so quick like rapid fire like so it was just it was kind of hard to keep up with in some   in some respects you'd be like oh right   yeah yeah yeah 
 yeah there must be in that in that patient's mind we've got like no idea what the process is I had   and that was like the most fascinating thing about it was just I thought to myself how how is his brain putting those words together you know and and what what association is he making between the two things and to him he was just like the words that were coming out would be you know like I say just sort of bam bam bam bam bam and I think he thought that was like er a complete sentence and he was kind of like looking around as if to sort of say like er you know do you know what I mean and we'd all be like just sitting there thinking mm yeah no I don't   really but yeah it was just yeah the most bizarre experience ever I'd have to say yeah it's er especially in nursing you do come across a lot of different things but that definitely stuck with me for something that's like you know kind of like   a once in a lifetime erm observation definitely yeah mm   yeah 
 mm not really to be honest no where I'm working at the moment I do agency so I do all different places but at the moment I'm m mainly based in it's kind of like elderly rehab although saying that we get a lot of people with erm like a dementia and they kind of have like almost like a form of psychosis sometimes and their language will be like sort of not it's not word salad or glossolalia particularly but they do have this kind of like association kind of thing you know they'll sort of like they'll say a word and then there's like something similar to it but it's kind of like mimics it a little bit it's not the same but ah yeah again it's like quite fascinating cos you kind of like you'll say to the person well what do you mean you know what do you mean by that or do you know where you are and then they launch off into s like a bit of a random sentence that's kind of got no structure at all but they're looking at you as if to go but yeah that's what that's what I mean   and they sort of like I think in their head it makes total sense but you're sort of thinking erm   so that's not making sense at all you know yeah 
 it could be and to be honest sometimes you find that like   randomly y you might get elderly people that will like make a word up they'll take two different words and kind of smash them together and make a different word and you're like OK that's quite an interesting word that's a good one it doesn't mean anything particularly and it's like just a bit of a nonsensical word but I do I like I find that quite erm yeah it's quite endearing and fascinating that they've kind of like made up this new word out of two existing words it's quite clever really but again it's I think they've got no idea that they've you know they made   up this completely new word I think they just they think it's like a you know an existing word or they can't find the word that they want so they'll just replace the word like you know sort of a semblance of of something that they think sounds the same yeah I f it er it's quite interesting I mean at the you know it can again it can be quite heart breaking at times you know if they're not able to you know erm tell you what they want or communicate what they need erm but yeah it can be quite interesting in some ways cos obviously like if if you've got an interest in language then if there's like just such a an obscure random pattern of language you think ooh that's quite   quite interesting you know   yeah yeah 
 sometimes it's a little bit hit and miss to be honest sometimes you can kind of think oh I think they were saying that and you'll say to them oh did you want or did you mean da da da da da and they'll go yeah yeah that's it but and then sometimes you'll say did you mean that and they'll go no and then they'll just go on to something completely different or like the word will have gone they'll just look for a completely different word altogether but yeah it can it can help if you've if your sort of knowledge of the English language is you know is pretty good then you can kind of think ooh perhaps they meant that you know or like you sort of look for a word similar to what they meant and maybe they meant that and that afterwards that's what they meant which is good but yeah it doesn't always follow that what you think they meant is what they meant you know   yeah   
 yeah pos I know what you mean it's it's mm we've er we have looked after patients in the past say for example if they've had a stroke and they have like n mm you know er th problems with their speech so erm w like I think it's like dysar they can't quite sort of say they look for a word and what they wanna say they can't quite get that word so they say something instead and yeah you find that if they've been living at home with their family and their family I mean obviously it's not at the minute but if their family are with them in hospital and they come out with a sentence you're kind of thinking oh I n I really don't know what they're trying to say and the family go oh he wants so and so or you know he wants erm a drink or he wants but that doesn't sound anything like what they've said but their family'll immediately know yeah they they're like oh he wants this or he wants that and it yeah possibly it's just because y you know you get to know your family so much better or you y you just learn the nuances of the person that you live with so you kind of like you can pick up on cues a lot better you know erm but yeah I er I I find that interesting as well is that you know something that you're like you're really struggling you're thinking oh is that could be like one of five things that they want but immediately their family or their wife their husband their son their daughter'll just be like oh yeah that's what they want they want so and so and they can go straight to the thing that they want it's just yeah it's quit erm I think it's quite fascinating really   yeah   
 er I'll probably get off the phone now and be like oh yeah I could've asked this   or I could've asked this it's always the way isn't it but no I just er I find the whole the whole subject is really interesting to me anything to do with language the human brain I just find it absolutely fascinating I just think we're just such a we're quite a creative species and we're sort of like our level of consciousness and awareness of of how bizarre and random our brains can be is just you know I think it's like really amazing it's such an amazing thing and I it's just nice being able to be sort of part of research as well you know take part it's really good   ",comparison
do you feel like you do creative things with language?," I really enjoyed it erm I felt in parts frustrated with myself because obviously with the pressure of finding some words the archives of your head erm but I found it enjoyable it was interesting during the creating words through the smart lab experiment just going through that process was interesting finding a rhythm behind it 
 yeah 
 mm 
 erm so from my understanding of it it was almost like it was constructing it felt like constructing your own rules behind erm if that makes sense so with the way the words came through and beginning to associate erm certain words with other words t towards the bottom so if it came through with an opinion and it felt like it could be phrased as an opinionated phrase assigning that and then when that change starting to put together a different word that would associate with opinion or attitude erm and then feeling that moment when you felt like the rules kind of flipped from that to try to associate that new phrase as you were going through until it felt like you'd self-constructed your own ruleset with that particular experiment 
 that's how it felt anyway 
 erm probably within the first five to ten words that came through as soon as it changed from being attitude opinion or something else as soon as the word edge or erm or con yeah considerations as well since they started to change and it f I'm yeah for some reason it just seemed to work in my head that I could put say edge and associate that with consideration another word could be associated with opinion it just became interchanging changing those words 
 yeah erm think of it from the so you'd have a word you'd consider you could associate with the top word you know if you had something that said salty sour and it was edge or opinion then obviously I'd have clicked on opinion before but if it came and it had consideration and edge I'd have associated edge more with opinion so that would have been that construct of the rule and then the other one would have been switched away from it so from there unless opinion and edge appeared together and then I would flip the way the words were assigned edge would have stayed as that one 
 erm so that was the feeling I got behind it 
 no no they they erm I would find if obv if I had two that were very very clearly linked together salty and sour for example I'd associate that with an opinion  because of the differing tastes that people could have the same for  but then if it was something a bit more subjective like it could be sour and smelly I would flip that to a consideration  because something to be smelly  seems like it would overwhelm something being sour in terms of what's with other people so that would be the one I would choose for that one 
 which was just 
 mm 
 mm 
 yeah cos interesting I think when I was picturing it in my head it was almost picturing it as though it would then impact on someone else not necessarily for me but on another person so that's when it that's when that idea of what would have a bigger impact of it being smelly or sour generally it would be the sense of smell would be something that would affect someone else first so that's where that came from so yeah the top problems almost got a ranking and then the bottom ones were assigned their own little rule set 
 mm  
 I think erm initially  I definitely felt like I've misread something  or not read something because I was waiting to know what I should have clicked or shouldn't have clicked erm but then after I think it was just after sort of using the more familiar words to associate with the top words and realising the words will change and then eventually you get two words you wouldn't probably place with those two top ones and it was like aromatic and fragrant in your words were edge and something 
 then you'd have to obv that's when that idea of creating the rule set for it came from 
 I would be interested  in how in the bottom words they were created  just to know why they were chosen in the way they were 
 if you can divulge that information 
 yeah yeah 
 mhm 
 mhm 
 mhm 
 yeah yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 mm 
 yeah 
 that's cool 
 yeah no that's no problem 
 it was an enjoyable experience   
 no no I think erm I'm I'm just I'm just glad to know roughly what we have from those ideas I've just been given this thing as well ",comparison
do you feel like you do creative things with language?," oh OK 
 cool er   it was it was interesting it was good it was yeah like that makes sense like I if I had an expectation of like what an experiment like that would be like that all seemed to make some sense   I guess 
 going through like oh the items which what like the like the phases of the experiment what do you think do you which what   
 yeah that was that was strange that was cool erm yeah like it it r remind it reminded me of like er a book I read that was written by someone with schizophrenia I was like oh yeah OK   erm so unfortunately maybe I was a bit loaded up with that but like obviously like there was no sense and it was really hard initially and then I was like that's OK just go with it and then like I kinda sort of found a rhythm with it weirdly even though there was like no rhythm to be found potentially but there was because   I dunno   I dunno because words are like a 
   
 mm   
 yeah yeah 
 sure yeah ah what was it called erm I only read half of it and it was like last summer maybe erm er I think over there maybe er it was like   what was it called hang on two seconds I think it's gonna be in there   erm um oh bummer it's not in here 
 it was called   it was called the center cannot hold and it was like erm it was about a person who like er kind of like gradually got like diagnosed with like really quite severe schizophrenia but they kind of went on to do loads of like I think they became a lawyer like how lots of people but they just kept their life was interrupted by all these like breaks of just like severe like medical trauma basically because like her experience with the institution which was like terrible and all this stuff but like throughout like the the prose of it like er it would just be like there would be like parts where like when she would have like a break or whatever like there would be she would yeah she would like just like write like the kind of like stream of like word association stuff so like I've r I've read like that before so like those those that that that like set of questioning like makes sense as like a thing erm that you would maybe like present to someone yeah sorry   is that I hope that's not too biasing or whatever but 
 OK   
 er yeah she did a few I think yeah erm yeah really cool bit of literature I thought it really might help 
 yeah 
 well not well like all of her writing obviously just like the parts where she was kind of  exit expressing like like like when she was having like a like an episode or whatever you would call it so like er yeah so she in she did include those bits like or like when she was like  accounting  erm when she was like talking to her psychiatrist and stuff like it would be like it along those lines I mean like apart from like like there there was other stuff as well but like that was definitely part of it that was like really obviously like specifically yeah 
 yeah yeah   I know what you mean   yeah 
 oh yeah erm that's yeah erm uh I don't know erm mm well I guess I guess cos I I read poetry as well sometimes and stuff like writing notes and sometimes  I'll just like stream of consciousness a bit  and like you know it doesn't always have to like like align too much like I don't know but like with those words like I found myself like erm attaching like only towards the end mind like this was like I guess how I started to make sense of it it was like   da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da kind of thing like that sort of thing like only towards the end and like but like initially when I started doing it I was like oh like the words themselves it's like oh you have a this or this or this like that could make sense as like a thing but then like eventually it didn't seem because everything was coming up so many times then it's like OK well they're having like this rhythm this rhythm kind of like as a as a whole thing would be a way to answer this question   or this association or whatever because otherwise you're just clicking randomly I suppose which I basically was but not really actually   yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 mhm 
 yeah yeah so like at one point I think I like even felt like  I wrote that I clicked the wrong one  I was like ah er no   do you know 
 yeah 
 I like I kind of I knew that it was but I felt like erm I felt like in the way that I was answering it erm it was like projecting meaning almost like a like so like it would be like if I like if I was like inconsistent with the way that I approached it I felt like I was doing it wrong that sort of thing maybe even though the consistency wasn't consistent   it was incon it wasn't really consistency there was just sort of like a leaning into a rhythm of how to answer it and like gathering meaning towards the end or something   
 because 
 yeah 
 I didn't think it didn't seem like there was a rule erm I don't know   but erm if there was a rule it would be to be consistent I guess or like I don't know erm yeah yeah   
 I don't know sorry 
 yeah 
 right 
 ah yeah I get it   OK yeah erm I guess because like because like it is presented like a test and it like obviously it's and like obviously it's like kind of like it's like totally open because none of it has like anything like coherency really erm but at the same time if you're not engaging with it then like you're not actually like then it's like you're not doing anything at all with the with the thing that you're interacting with so you just have to like engage with it one on one w otherwise you haven't got like it's a meaningless interaction I think or something like that 
 yeah yeah 
   yeah 
   yeah 
 mhm 
 erm er er like only in that that like anything is creative I think like you can make anything sort of like yeah I wouldn't necessarily like maybe it was like more towards creative than than like a test   but I don't know I think everything is pretty much creative so like that's that's the answering that is a bit 
 yeah   
 erm I wish I did I feel a bit like  brain splattered    so I don't really know 
 but yeah 
 well thank you   yeah 
 yeah erm that's kind of like all I really do at the moment   erm yeah like er like music mostly but at the moment I'm doing like like er lyrics as well which is a bit new relatively speaking so like sort of in this flow and I do baking which is not specifically creative but like it is   so I don't know it's like improvising and like creating kind of thing so yeah I don't know erm  and I'm a graphic designer but so it's all creative over here    
 mhm 
   yeah it's just like  a favourite thing  to try and do just like really really kind of like quite straightforward things like things that kind of like should be like  to get to give  like one like very small example from something I wrote like ages ago I think I I like synthesise the word  lifescape  and like put that in a in like a set of lyrics and I was like that's so good   like you know it's not a thing but you know what it means you know that kind of stuff 
 yeah   erm yeah it's always a bit like that it's just kind of like input like I just a think a little part of like a familiar thing and then just like kind of like release this whole new association   kind of thing that's what I try and do 
 or like   yeah 
 yeah I think like you know it's stuff that is like it's not it's not like brand new like it is referring to something that is already something that you would like already know about like like cos it is just using it is using like familiar like concepts like life and scape   like as in like a like a landscape like you know like it's the whole scope of it kind of thing so it could be like the scope of your life or whatever erm so yeah it's just like joining together things that like already probably should be together cos it is already a concept it's just like identifying it with the words sort of thing that's how I get it   if you if that is a does that make sense   is that yeah 
 mm 
 mhm 
 wow   that's amazing 
 oh that's great that's amazing oh 
 mm 
 wow that first bit's so powerful sorry   that's really good 
 yeah   
 nice image right yeah 
 er no er no I don't I think that's that's that's me good I rea I wish I did have something additional to say but I think not   on this occassion ",comparison
how was the experiment?,"    erm different and it was quite interesting I think I questioned my own abilities erm but it was it was fun and it was different to other experiments that I've done 
 yes probably 
 erm so I was yeah I was curious as to whether it was right the whole time    
 erm yeah I'd probably say it was because erm just because there were two answers on this one so it was either a yes or a no you're right or you're wrong  
 so that's how it felt erm yeah 
 erm I don't know they were quite random words so I found that er interesting erm and I didn't know whether it made much sense and obviously because they were repeated so many times I think I probably made different answers and different choices erm cos I couldn't remember which I'd done originally erm so yeah no I c so    there were so many different options it was it was confusing 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 er yeah I think so I think because I've done a few experiments before I thought not to read into it too much because obviously you'll be analysing a massive data set erm but yeah I think it's interesting and I'll be interested to find out the er outcomes of the study 
 mhm 
 erm I don't think it affected my selections I think I was surprised about how they were just they were so random but it didn't affect it no 
 because they weren't difficult words to understand 
 mhm 
 erm I didn't want to overthink my answers because obviously there were quite a lot to get through erm but I think my choices they probably differed so one question Iâ€™ll have answered one way and then erm several questions down the line I'll have answered it a different way I think just because I c simply couldn't remember the way I answered it originally 
 yeah 
 erm yeah I think so I think it's probably quite different to what I normally do so it was it was creative in that respect 
 yeah 
 erm I don't it possibly was restricted like you said you were only given a few words erm but I don't know if I'm that creative anyway that I would've been able to think of other words erm especially I think cos you're under a time pressure I think it would have been difficult to have thought of my own er words to use 
 erm possibly where erm where I stand in the first section of the experiment    
 yeah 
 oh OK 
 OK 
 I'll take 
 mm 
 mhm 
    mm yeah 
 exactly 
 I think it's like being on a game show y just    can't remember anything 
 no thank you ",comparison
how was the experiment?,"   erm yes er I I you er oh I thought we were talking about the practice ones I didn't quite understand what I was trying to do erm and that's probably says more about my personality erm than anything else and wanting to know how er a task works erm but yeah it was strange  I was aware there was becoming a pattern  of how I was responding erm not a pattern in that erm you know it was always the left or the right but it was a pattern in that if a certain word was one of the two words then I would if if another certain word was one of the words at the bottom I would naturally be drawn there and started the word association between some words erm became quite strong erm and and also almost sort of a weird hierarchy of words of the two words erm s which I I can't tell you now probably which the words even are erm but y it sort of the other word almost didn't matter if that word was there I was in I had to then choose you know one of the two whichever one it was underneath if that makes any sense 
   
 I don't I think the first one I noticed was erm the word stroked if stroked was there consideration was always the first choice of the two words erm yeah that was that was the first one I n I noticed that like almost if if stroked there I didn't care what the other word was erm 
 if consideration was an option stroked and consideration had to be linked erm yeah erm and then I noticed a pattern that was er er things like salty was going with sharp with sharpene erm I detested the word boomerang and I didn't want to give give it a chance erm but then I realised that I was ignoring it   and felt sorry for it erm and then tried to go come on now seriously erm so I probably then put some bias back in it by choosing it b it when it was just the least you know it wasn't that bad a choice in that situation erm 
 it was yeah it was really interesting 
   yeah I know didn't like sharpener but when edge and attitude weren't an option for words er yeah that were sort of er so verbs I suppose like you know spicy erm fragrant obviously wasn't so bad but erm yeah then  sharped  starting to use at one point I decided it was a fix cos I was given sharpener and boom and boomerang and I just didn't know what to do with myself because at that point I I didn't want to use either of those words for anything 
 erm   yeah 
   
 oh 
 yeah 
 mm 
 mm yeah 
 er to start with like sort of you know just didn't understand in you know er a a simple erm instruction to you know match match the words at the bottom and the the top and you th oh yeah that you know which word finishes this sentence that sort of thing and then just went and went oh no no it's not that kind of a task erm sometimes sometimes you could make it into that and I was I was trying to make sentences in my head erm and going you know oh that would oh that describing a person using the words at the top going oh they have you know they have quite you know spicy opinions or they have quite a erm a a si a silent visual attitude or something like that trying trying to build sentences trying trying to make sense of the task because I didn't understand it which is the entire point I know   erm but   erm yeah 
 sometimes yes yeah erm trying to find er creating a way of making that link and building a story perhaps in a way between to to make it make sense to link those bottom and those  dottom  and top words I wasn't thinking about the fact that this was an experiment erm a couple of times I think probab probably when you know the distractors came in and   and then at that point went oh wait a minute what should I do but I did try and just go with what what would this be erm and try to build something up between them I suppose 
   
 yeah 
 erm I think because some of once I was trying to link things it became easier to link them and it was just I don't know it was just it was it was a simple task it was not a simple task it was a match these things up oh w w er you know like making a decision in a workplace what are we going to do about this oh do that do that you know erm in r in recruiting you know which which candidate are we going to go with oh well that one erm obviously it's not how recruitment works but   I'm not a recruiter but erm yeah it it just became a task to complete and there was a point when I did go how long does this last   erm because you had told me but I I that I wasn't really I wasn't paying any attention to time my screen was maximised I couldn't see the clock I mean I didn't even think of looking at my watch that would be far too logical erm but yeah I think also I don't know in some ways that's it did feel like an experiment because I didn't understand what the endpoint was erm but yeah I j sort of got on with it I suppose   
 and tried not to think too much about it trying to go with gut reaction there were a couple times when I went oh yeah I've been on the right for a bit come on this just looks like I'm just pressing the right and then going no that's not what this is about come on actually and and don't dither about which answer you should give which answer was your first answer where where was your gut it instinct 
 mm 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 not that I can think of it it's it's fascinating erm   erm but no not really no but it the the rule thing yeah there definitely was a rule there was an attempt attempt to make make order out of what in my mind was chaos because 
 I didn't understand the I didn't understand it total chaos that that yeah and desperately trying to build some rules and some structure and st and s some stability so then I knew what to do so it got easier erm 
 until then something came in and derailed the whole thing   
 oh w the rule doesn't work what do I do mm yeah yeah 
 I don't worry 
 mm 
 people going what   
 it it may have done yeah it may have done I don't know in the data that you get if it records the response time 
 oh good good yeah because that I I imagine that is yeah that b well that shows when you have that moment of going your rule has been broken what do I do now erm yeah g good I'm glad it does have that because that yeah must be really interesting erm yeah ",comparison
how was the experiment?," well it sort of reminded me of the sort of test you do on people with dementia   so I think ooh   
 erm that that sort of thing yeah I I think it's partly from my own experiences cos my father had it quite early so whenever I sit and do any kind of verbal reasoning test I get quite panicky but   it was fine 
 erm 
 the the the  tor  the story about Anna and the diamond ring because when they do erm cognitive assessments they quite often ask you to repeat something after a little while afterwards 
 so I you know it's just a personal thing really erm 
 right 
 OK 
 right 
 OK 
 yes 
 erm it was fine I think sometimes I would be I'm er almost inclined to you know you sort of looked at something through I don't quite see the match there and you're sort of desperately trying to find the link and I think you go through that routine so then after a while I realized that the same things were coming up and I was thinking am I answering in the same way or erm y you know am I getting it right so it was interesting 
 yes 
 yeah 
 that is interesting oh w OK 
 yeah sorry lost you a little bit then   
 yeah definitely 
 yeah 
 yeah definitely 
 oh   I seem to be losing your signal a little bit 
 w oh 
 there OK I think it's my net mm I'm clear now I think it's my network it's a bit ropy sometimes 
 erm yeah 
 yeah definitely 
 that would be interesting actually 
 yes 
 mm 
 oh well erm that's really interesting I think that to some extent you do some things subconsciously if that makes sense it it's the way your brain works because for me erm it's one of those it's interesting when you're using words like metaphor that that's not really in my vocabulary it's not something that I ever had to formally learn about although I know what it means so it's not you know erm part of  what can I say you  it's almost like you're for me the experience was like my brain was desperately hunting for oh I've heard that phrase before and it all links up if that makes sense 
 erm 
 it was just after the beginning cos it is a kind of you know when you look at it's kind of I think it's the way you perceive it is to me it was a mind puzzle so I was thinking right OK w where's the connection and you you can feel your mind going backwards and looking for the words and then as you get to the repetition side you start to think did I answer like that last time and was that right and then the right or wrong thing 
 that make sense 
 yes I think so yeah yeah and I think I b I really put that down to like erm a sort of I don't know for me it was a bit like an educational thing if that makes sense 
 yes because interestingly it's like hopefully it's not a digression but my daughter 
 has been taught grammar at school but I never was so I've had to learn from her but I understand patterns if that makes sense 
 so I w I wouldn't necessarily know the name for what you're talking about but I would understand how to use it so 
 it with my daughters as the terms so you know I you know still struggle with the terms I have learnt them a little bit from her but I think well I I write anyway so when I'm writing I tend to look for patterns 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 oh definitely that that was the whole thing you know I d er I think when I first started with the looking to put them into a phrase  and then after that I was well that's a consideration  that's that's you know and I really struggled with say boomerang cos I thought is that something that I don't quite know or is it you know it it it I was looking at the top word so I was might be thinking erm for example if you said spice then if you said something that was a similar adjective would that mean that it was a boomerang cos it was bouncing back to the other word 
 so all sorts of other   crazy things were going on there 
 erm   yeah but yeah it was it was really interesting cos like I said you were sort of thinking or if you had edge you thought erm does it need an edgy word or does that mean that erm you have to fit that into the phrase it it just like you know it was quite interesting really   
 yeah 
 sure 
 yeah 
 yes it did yeah I I it er it started to think about the words that you use for the choices they were more erm you know I could sort of imagine a a Victorian book or a you know a really descriptive n novel or something from them rather than than being just technical words if that makes sense 
 yeah 
 oh that's good yeah 
 erm I think it was fine I d I sort of like you know I d I didn't have a moment where I thought what does that word mean which was like my slight panic on the side I thought what if there's a word I don't know what it is erm but it was always about mm like I said it's almost a creative pro well you said that it's creative process of sort of joining them up and making sense of them in a way 
 you know what I think that that's there's part of the way that the mind works maybe is trying to put things into an order or 
 erm process put the categorise them is   is another way of looking at it I suppose but making  a sense  out of them and trying different ways to make  a sense  
 erm er it was really interesting I really enjoyed it I think I don't know it it might you know I was saying about not knowing grammar and so on there's I don't know if this is something that is interesting to you but a lot of people of my generation didn't do grammar at school and you'll find people that are older than us did and then the system changed probably in the erm what nineties and they brought it back 
 so I don't know how that affects your experiment if that make sense 
 erm 
 yeah 
 OK 
 yeah 
 yeah yeah yeah 
 yes 
 yes 
 yes yes so there's an order to it yeah 
 yes 
 yes 
 mm oh that's interesting 
 mhm 
 oh 
 yeah 
 OK oh that's interesting 
 oh that interest cos you when you were working out of   did you see people behave you know kind of acting out in that way 
 with their language 
 right 
 mm 
 right 
 oh mm 
 right 
 that's interesting 
 yeah yeah well it sounds really interesting   it's a very interesting piece of work to be doing 
 that's alright   
 yeah 
 well that's well I I always feel you know erm I sort of think about   and I think possibly there's more that could have been done and and so I'm really happy to help you know 
 erm   
 yeah 
 yeah 
 oh you weren't at all   
   
 yeah yeah 
 yeah it's tough 
 yeah 
 I think I think as well I think within the NHS understanding different things to sort of like you know if you take this medication or erm  observational studies is a real challenge  erm I've only learned that from doing my MSc really you know sort of standing outside of the circle cos I think you know it it there could be better research but the structure is not there to support people enough 
 you know and I'm sure your finding with university that it's much better and there are lots of resources to help you get off the ground 
 mm 
 oh definitely 
 oh definitely 
 I think that yeah I mean there are there are more things than perhaps you know a couple of years ago but I still think it could go a lot further and I think the other thing that I would say in hindsight is I think erm research in  depart dud development departments  in the NHS they're not you know I drifted into research I wasn't doing it before I got there and erm it was a massive learning curve erm and I think that's something else the NHS could be a bit better at if that that makes sense although they have got a bit more scrutiny from the NIHR now and and also the clinical research networks do sort of expect you to do certain things but in terms of staff understanding and training it was always quite limited erm you know you were sort of working it out on the job and I think that that you know really is the it it's easy  when it's like I said really straightforward experiment  cos consultants know what they're doing but if it's something slightly more difficult or complicated then erm we just don't have the framework for it you know and we should do really 
 erm 
 oh yeah 
 yeah 
   ah 
 yeah 
 yeah definitely 
 yes 
 oh that's good 
 yeah 
 yeah there's yeah sorry 
 that's 
 ah erm I er I can't think of anything and I mean like I said it's been a really interesting and I really hope that you know it it helps 
 mm 
 yeah we're all ",comparison
how was the experiment?,"   erm it was it was quite interesting erm yeah er like like the last the last one was really interesting cos it was I don't know if there was sort of some a association with how we like can mm have different meanings for a word which can either be sort of  conceptual and study abstract  or sort of kind of a descriptive manner erm and even though some of the words I was like I d d I don't really know where they fit but somehow I could sort of relate it to maybe an attitude or opinion more so than you know it a word that you'd use to describe something concrete I suppose but I was sort of mm  leaning more to using them to describe something  quite abstract erm it was quite interesting and I think yeah in terms of sort of like er creative writing I could see how that would sort of create a lot of diversity within   you know how they can use words and stuff I suppose sort of add richness to a text which might not seem logically sort of doesn't make sense logically but you can yeah it sort of fits somehow 
 yeah I'd be really interested 
 yeah I think in the back of my head I was like   like I might have associated like smelly with like a consideration and I mean I I was trying to sort of go through it as well so I didn't sort of dwell too much on it but I was kind of like oh in what sort of context would someone be   inconsiderate but in a smelly and erm 
 in a smelly and rough way   like 
 like like it's sort of yeah but like as an attitude as well you can sort of visualize it as an as an attitude like when you say someone's like smelly or rough they're just sort of not easy to get along with and quite erm I dunno there's a lot of friction in the dynamics or something like that 
 and it was also interesting erm I I don't know if it's true but I thought sort of some of them erm some of the pairings came up again I don't know if it was all exactly the same but some similar ones came up and I think I think at first it w it was very confusing like you said because it's the adjectives well they don't really fit either the concrete or the abstract thing sort of exactly so I think at first it was sort of like some kind of blind association but at the more I did it the more I was like oh yeah maybe someone could be smelly and rough in their attitude or something like that so it I think I did get more and more as I went along 
 yeah I think erm cos I think everything yeah I think I I was just like I was sort of very concrete in the way I was looking at the words at first but the more they came up like the further along in erm I just my just found myself sort of just being like oh yeah just it you know it doesn't have to be exactly as you know it just sort of go with what seems to flow and then like towards the end it was when I started to make those associations of someone being you know smelly and rough er or aromatic in their attitude h er type of thing like that that came along sort of further down the line I think 
 yeah 
 how do you mean like 
 if that word came up then I'd more associate it with mm 
 erm I guess the the things at the top just cos they were sort of adjectives erm I think eventually like the opinion and the attitude and the consideration they sort of merged into sort of just the abstract part of it erm so unless there was an adjective that I could sort of p really associate with the you know the edge or the boomerang which there wasn't much I think erm I did sort of veer towards the er erm the abstract forms I think I don't know if that makes any sense   
 yeah 
 erm I I think maybe because I think I was trying to create that like m that more towards the end I w I think maybe I was trying to focus more on the feeling that the adjectives sort of gave towards the either the abstract thing or the concrete thing erm and yeah like it doesn't matter whether it was an attitude or an opinion like if it's sort of if the adjectives kind of helped maybe less consciously like helped me sort of visualize maybe a person or situation the feel of it I think maybe I did incline to to do that whereas with the concrete thing I just I think I just looked at the adjectives very briefly and just I was just like OK there's nothing that's hugely descriptive in terms of you know like if it was like fragrant and aromatic or something like that it was just it was really hard to make that something concrete for me erm and so yeah and that would sort of give me like a feeling of sort of like a very nice conversation or a nice relationship and then y er im immediately that would become a  more of a abstract thing for me  I think 
 I think I'd yeah maybe I just kind of erm yeah if I couldn't immediately fit into something that was concrete I'd just yeah no matter kind of what mm w p what the two items at the bottom were it was just whether it was s if if it wasn't something concrete then  I'd just consider it to be something abstract as the second part  
 yeah yeah yeah 
 yeah and I think as well there was there was a lot more like I guess just because it's abstract in nature means that you could sort of associate it with with lots of different things like you can sort of twist meanings or things to make them sort of fit within the abstract so aromatic doesn't really mean anything when you use it an as an opinion but then you could sort of associate it with someone having very I don't know nice like opinions or considerations and stuff whereas it's quite hard to fit into a boomerang   
   
 yeah 
 no I do I do agree with that comment actually it it was I th I think I probably chose boomerang out of all the items I probably chose boomerang like associated anything with boomerang a lot less than yeah 
 I think maybe if it was if there was like a sm if there was something similar to s   adjective I might have paired it but yeah I couldn't imagine I can mm imagine like a smooth or rough edge like it like I think for those items it was it was a bit more visual erm as opposed to sort of creative abstracting and   in any way that sort of didn't fit I suppose I think in terms of like   I don't know if I was  if it was a child cartoon or something  I might be able to have like a perfumed boomerang or something like that but it wasn't there was it was less realistic to me than imagining someone having like an aromatic per s like opinion about something 
 yeah yeah like yeah I think so especially with the erm I think especially with the sort of more abstract like the opinion erm like I said in in the back of my head I could sort of like er I was very briefly sort of imagining a conversation which was sort of rough and smelly  or like fragrant and aromatic type of  well like a person who was very considerate in a fragrant   kind of way erm and like yeah so I could sort of see that in the back of my head and like I think I don't know if I was trying to justify something that wasn't that I wasn't used to like an association that I wasn't used to but I could sort of build something and I could feel you know there might be a way that you know a conversation could could be described as such even though it's not what you might usually see so I guess in that sense it is sort of creative in that way 
 erm I'm interested in how the first two exercises linked   
 yeah 
 mm 
 mm 
 yeah 
 yeah erm I dunno cos you you said everybody always does better than they think they do what what what's so do do people always think that they don't find as many M words 
 or animals they 
 what's the average   
 mm 
 oh 
   yeah 
 so don't do those two measures do those two measures so those two measures are a measure of language ability 
 OK 
 mhm 
 mm 
 like linguistics type of thing 
 so with sc schizophrenia though does it affect their like ah ah ah I h I have no idea like I'm not I haven't read up about schizophrenia or anything but sort of is there to some extent does it affect sort of their language or I assume that's why you're doing it particularly around creative writing 
 mm 
 mm 
 so are you sort of expecting like erm so to do with th sort of the last test that we did are you sort of expect that I dunno that they find it harder to sort of make an association or what kind of things are you looking out for 
 ah 
 OK 
 OK 
 oh just bear with me a second   sorry 
 mm 
   yeah all the best with it have you done have you sort of reaching your sample size 
 or is it still a way there 
 oh sorry I was just asking how sort of are you sort of getting close to reaching the sample size you want or 
   
 oh wow 
 yeah yeah where are you based like you're oh Manchester yeah or I don't know if you are 
 oh nice   I hope you've got better weather there then   
 yeah   that's great   it's always good yeah the midlands is a bit grim but 
 ah it's just grim and cloudy but no rain so I shouldn't complain really   
 yeah 
 erm not that I can think of I mean yeah it was really interesting and yeah thanks for letting me take part thank ",comparison
how was the experiment?," erm yeah it was kind of weird   erm it was absolutely fine and there was no it was just a bit weird I don't really know how else to explain it 
 like I kept 
 I kept thinking all throughout like have I missed something was there a connection there that I was supposed to be sort of picking up or something like that and then I was kind of like but I mean the words are kind of repeated but in very random orders and then we're getting the same words and different choices and things like th and it was just yeah 
 erm I think for me it was more   I clearly wasn't as concerned as I possibly should have been because I could have asked the question have I actually missed an instruction somewhere erm but I was ninety-nine percent certain I didn't miss any instructions so I was kinda like OK I'm just gonna go with it erm but it was just more I think it was it was actually quite uncomfortable for me because I like knowing what I'm supposed to be doing 
 I mean I'm I'm very much you've probably got it from the initial assessment I'm very much I like to it's not so much I like to get things right I mean that's true but I like to when I'm doing something I kind of give it my all even if I'm not amazing at it erm and I'd I mean with the questions at the start it was like name some animals I know animals so and it's it's that pressure you're put on the spot but you know that you can answer something whereas this was very much it was very abstract it was very kind of I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing really 
 OK 
   I mean it's yeah no it's good to know because as I say I I'd I do I do like to get things right so yeah when I when I try something and I think I think I've done I mean I've done things like quizzes and stuff like that and you all have your specialist subjects but when it's something like this and it's quite random I mean I don't get asked words beginning with M and put on the spot every day kind of thing so it is quite random but I kind of feel like yeah OK yay I er I'd I'd sort of achieved something there and then it was just that complete flip of I don't know what I'm doing here   
 OK 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 erm some more than others because I think with with some of them I was sort of drawn to one option more than the other 
 erm ah I don't know maybe it was a kind of word association thing or something like that that there was something sort of erm in the back of my head I was sort of drawn to one more than the other but then w I mean er the w the word boomerang appeared quite a lot and I was kinda like but I mean there's there's really not much of a connection here that I can go with either of them so a lot of the time I was making so I think I started off trying to make the choice of what I not so much what I thought was right but more what I felt was right and then it as it sort of went on and I was getting the word like boomerang or sharpener coming up which to me had really no connection I was more often choosing the other one because that had no connection so I think I changed my approach to it 
 not not necessarily for everything but certainly when when certain ones came up I was kind of like no I've got no connection with that at all so I'm gonna go with the other one rather than picking the one that I did have a connection with so it was a a bit of an  approach change  
 er I'd say I mean I can't be exact but I'd say it was probably about halfway through 
 I mean   I was trying not to I was trying not to sort of second guess myself in in the sense that I wasn't sort of guessing right in the first place but I was trying n I was trying to go with my instinct first of all and then it just it kind of got to the point that I mean as I say I was sort of thinking have I missed something is there something else here and then I thought well because I was thinking ab w d I think I felt more comfortable when I switched to the other approach of let's go with the one that it's not that sorry let's not go with the one that I don't connect with rather than let's go with one that I connect with more and I felt a little bit more comfortable and er f I'd say yeah probably about halfway through ish 
 OK 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 I think it was that's a good question actually it was more about the wor er it's it was more about the choices 
 it was more about the choices yeah 
 yeah I mean though I found those words I mean it was a bit weird because there were times er with er it was it was less often but there were times with the words sometimes that I was kind of looking at going I g I've got nothing here I've just got nothing together with that and it was that kind of so th it it there were almost sort of four different things there were things where the words at the top went together and I could quite easily pick one of the two options  then you've got the words at the top went together but neither of the options sort of appealed to me  then you had the words at the top not really slotting together and neither of the options appealing to me and the words at the top not really slotting together and it wasn't that ah one was better than er it it was it was basically that one was worse than the oth one of the options was worse than the other so I went for the better option if that makes sense 
 but that wasn't really occurring to me at the time it's sort of occurring to me now looking back on it 
 yeah 
 it yeah it I mean I think at first when you're seeing the words repeated but not necessarily exactly the same and everything like that there's that possibility in your head of going on well this is just really random words coming up and everything like that and you know obviously it's it's it's got a basis in the research and everything so it's not gonna be completely random there's gonna be er a process to it but again  I don't think I I sort of dissected it while I was doing it was more now I'm sort of looking back and going that's probably why I picked that rather than and I'd think as well for me I I've never classed myself as a creative person I'm very much er a tangible certainly in terms of ideas and and the abstract and stuff like that so that'd be quite interesting as to what side I came down on that 
 oh that'd be great 
 yeah 
 that's absolutely fine yeah 
 yeah 
 I'd be quite interested in that actually 
 yeah 
 erm I don't think so I mean it was good to it was yeah it was good to sort of get that understanding I think I think if I'd just kind of gone away after it I'd have been going what on Earth was that 
 it was it and that weirdness now the weirdness doesn't really seem as weird anymore it was more I think recognize now that I've recognized what I did and why I did what I did in a way making those choices it's it's l a lot less weird 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 I do like stuff like this because I I find I do find that I learn a little bit more about myself each time I do something like this 
 which is quite good 
 I'm not   I say I'm not a reflective person I actually did a study a couple of months back where all I was doing was every day for two weeks was a five minute video diary and it was they they gave you kind of prompt questions but you could kind of talk about whatever you liked I've never kept a diary in my life 
 but doing this and you could do it at any time during the day erm I think it was between eleven o'clock in the morning and eleven o'clock at night you could do it at any time and it was just the s the amount that I've learned about myself just from doing that for two weeks 
 it's brilliant 
 so yeah I love stuff like this 
 yeah 
 yeah no absolutely and I think that's part of it for me is if you only stick with the stuff that you're comfortable with and stuff that you know you're not really gonna you you might sort of build on your skills in those areas but you're not gonna sort of expand what you do know 
 which isn't for everyone but it is for me that's the kind of thing that I quite like to do I'm not saying I wanna go out and I dunno learn how to crochet or something but little things like this I think can help just develop develop you 
 and if I mean for me one of the big things I've w always wanted to work on is my understanding of myself in terms of reflection cos it's not something I'm mm good at 
 I think I think it's not something I'm good at on my own maybe   
 I think if you put me if if you put me in a position like this where I'm directly asked that question in even even sort of in the in the context of how did you find that erm or in in the video diary example whereas if I was just to try and do something like that for myself I'd either get bored of it or it would take a long time for me to kind of get into that habit of sitting there and going actually how was my day 
 so I think I do find that I I get more of a sense of purpose out of it when I am doing it for something or for someone else kind of thing whereas just for myself maybe I'm not as good so it's good to know that I can do it and clearly I can do it it's just now finding the  impetus  and the reason and the purpose for doing it 
 yes 
 yeah I think that's exactly it I think it's like anything if if you really want to do something you're going to make the time for it and I think for me I I f find that I will make time for things that involve other people more than I'd make time for something just for myself I mean we all we all have our own time we all have our me time and everything like that erm but I think setting aside even if it was just setting aside five minutes in a day to do a video diary I could do that for a research project but to get that into my head to just do it for myself would take a lot more effort I think   
 erm but I don't know that's ah d and again that's that's just a reflection on myself that I know I'd like to work on erm because it's exactly as you say I think there there's that never ending you've got everything going on you've got work going on you've gotta go and do the shopping you gotta do the housework you gotta make the dinner whatever you've gotta do throughout your normal day and trying to put something into that routine where it's not going to be a tr I think that's the key thing as well you don't want it to be seen as a chore   
 you don't wanna be sitting there going oh well I have to do this today 
 so 
 yep 
 yeah 
 but no this was really fun 
 this was really fun
