# Schizophrenia-Detection-with-NLP

This graduation project aims to detect the presence of schizophrenia through natural language processing techniques applied to the 'Discussing Abstract Ideas in Schizophrenia Corpus (DAIS-C)' data. By using various machine learning algorithms and text vectorization/embedding methods, this project focuses on classifying whether a person exhibits signs of schizophrenia based on their speech patterns and linguistic characteristics.

## Project Details
* Language: Python 3
* Environment: Jupyter Notebook
* ML Algorithms Used: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM
* Text Vectorizers and Embedding Methods: TF-IDF, Count Vectorizer, Word2Vec, BERT
